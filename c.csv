7,Jan 2021,Don’t forget packing your toothbrush or else you need to pay the penalty!,"We stayed twice in the hotel on our way to Vizag and back from Pune The first time, we stayed in room 921, while the second time we were allotted room no 821- both booked as business room with approximately same cost. Surprisingly, in. room 821... neither dental kit nor shaving kit or face tissues were provided in the bathroom. On Inquiring we were told, it’s on chargeable basis . Their logic is, for the top floors (from 9th onwards) it comes complimentary. I was surprised!! Won’t a guy staying in the 8th floor and below brush his teeth??? I don’t understand what sort of business they are doing!!!

The bathing space is too small... you may hurt yourself if not extra cautious- it’s true for all business rooms.

The food is super expensive but not worthy enough as per the taste and the time they take to serve!!

Good thing- the mattress and pillows are good and the location is just great!!

In Hyderabad there are a number of good hotels that come up with the same or may be less price as compared to Lemon tree premier... so think and decide!!

Last but not the least, in the name of Covid precautions, they won’t assist you to your room.. you need to carry your own luggage from the parking to the room and back... there is no valet available to park your car!!

Hot Water is not available 24 hours but on request they will provide you a bucket of hot water... so it’s worrisome...",2.0,January 2021,couple,Sourav Goswami,76,8,"Pune, India",,,,,,

i would like to begin this review by thanking Mr. Dinesh from the sales team for providing me a fabulous deal and also for checking up on me from time to time if i was facing any inconveniences. I am impressed my your prompt and very good support.

Then i would like to thank the front desk team within which i interacted with Mr. Shubham and Mr. Shiva both were very helpful and fixed any of my room related problems quickly.

Then i would like to thank the House keeping team consisting of Mr. Suyansh and Mr. Nagesh for being meticulous and thorough with their jobs. Thank you both for doing all the housekeeping and laundry related chores with perfection.

Then i would like to mention the most important team that actually made a lot of difference in making me feel good during my stay...the food department and before i begin this part of the review i would like to give a special thanks to Lipi Mam for doing exceptionally well in providing a great homely service all throughout the stay.

Being greeted by Mr. Bala Sravan and Lipi Mam early in the mornings was a delight and i also had the opportunity to be served by Mr. Shreedhar Mr. Shivam Mr. Anil Mr. Guarav and Mr. Bhaskar. , thanks a lot for those wonderful breakfasts.

The dinners were lovey and were handled beautifully by Lipi Mam, i felt homely and it was a delight being pampered like a small kid. I don't have an elder sister but Lipi Mam made sure that if i had one i would want her to be like Lipi Mam. Keep up the good work !! because i have seen you bring smiles to so many faces during my stay.

Then i would like to thank the people who worked behind the scenes in the food department chefs Alam and Madan, all your non veg delicacies including chicken were top notch and especially that rajma dish was lip smacking. Your food sure would lift up ones spirits after a long hard day...

Lastly if i have missed someone in this review or if there is someone whose names i might have not remembered but were a part of making my stay better, a heartfelt thanks to all those people.

Thanks Lemon Tree HITEC city team..Kudos and keep up the good work!!!

There is one tiny thing that i would like to mention it to the Lemon Tree HITEC city team and that would be to allow proper ventilation and opening of windows because the central AC was bringing in smell of cigarettes also from other rooms.

Our event manager Ranjan and F&B executive Veda Vyas were around through out the time ensuring the guests were continuously fed with the delicious food prepared by Chef Madan and team. Every item on the menu from several starters to the desserts competed with each other to be the highlight of the day. I started with thinking Lasooni Murgh Tikka was a highlight but am inclined to vote for Shahi Tukda as we ended the meal with it’s sweetness.

Thanks to Gaurav (Ops Mgr) for continuously monitoring.

From a stay perspective , we booked the Presidential Suite , that was excellent with two big bed rooms, a large hall and a dining hall, a balcony and overall worth the money. Good view of the Hitech city metro station and the passing metro trains from the balcony.

A special shout out to Veda Vyas for going above and beyond to ensure our other meals such as breakfast and lunch in the in room dining were excellent as well.

Huge thanks to the Sales Director Sagnik for selling the right services to the right customer and ensuring they are delivered beyond expectations.

Hotel staff were very helpful and organised a taxi for me to explore and to see the Aarti which I appreciated.

We were very happy with todays visit, their service levels were outstanding, and the food was exceptionally done well.
During a special occasion most restaurants just place a cake on the table. At the Republic of Noodles, it is done differently. They brought in a trolley decorated with a fine cloth and rose petals all over. They do things differently yet keep things simple and that is what amuses me. I am also Platinum with Lemon Tree and when ever constructive feedback is given, it is implemented. This is one chain of hotels that I have been very impressed with, their approach towards addressing anything, either an occasion or even a concern is different and innovative.

She is to be commended for not only the culinary delights she produces but her attentiveness and SUPERB customer service. From the moment I stepped into the food oasis she made me feel so at home and couldn’t do enough for me. The ‘special’ some kind of chaat she made for me was insanely delicious, as were the other indo Chinese dishes I savoured. The desert mithai slices -White with chocolate centre was absolutely DIVINE, on a par with some of the leading mithai companies. Would highly recommend this place.

This feels the same as the other feedback here.

The only drawback - when checking out, I paid by credit card, and the amount was charged in Rupees. Only after few days, when looking at the credit card report, I found out that the credit card was charged by USD, with a hefty commission of 69 USD just for the currency conversion that I didn't ask them to. They had to ask me if I want to be charged in another currency (And I would have refused). This is apart from the commission of the bank transaction.
You can find some article about it over the web.

What they did is kind of illegal.
I complained to the 'Lemon tree' but didn't get any reply.

I once ordered a pure Hyderabadi dish and couldn't hold on to that level of spice. The chef and the backend team made a special visit to ensure my health was ok. Matter of fact I fell ill and caught up with a viral and was given simple cafeteria food that helped me recover. Also a big shout out to the front desk team Sagia and Ng aveen, who addressed all my requests no matter what. I felt like home away from home and was well taken care off.

294,Aug 2019,"Great Place, Awesome People","Trip Details: I stayed here for the whole month of July on a business trip.

Rooms: My room was 920 for my whole stay (mentioning this because some hotels change it midway through your stay) and I must say I was thoroughly satisfied. The room was spacious and comfortable. I prefer natural lighting and I found no problems there - just open the curtains and you have a brightly lit room. One thing that I must mention is that there are no balconies, but that wasn't an issue for me. The AC and the steam iron worked well too. No complaints.

Staff: The staff were probably the highlight for my stay. Not everywhere are you greeted with as much charm as this place. The security folks were cordial and helpful. The people at the reception were considerate - obliging to any and every request you bothered them with. Special mention to Rajma for her hospitable attitude. The room service is excellent - Rajashekhar (housekeeper) and Bhadra were amiable in their interactions with me and took good care of my room the whole month.

Location: The location is great too. You have many prominent places for foodies - Paradise Biryani, Cream Stone and Karachi Bakery to name a few. Also, there is an IKEA at a 10-minute walking distance. There was construction going on for the metro down the road and the traffic was a bit heavy in the evenings, but I guess you expect that in a city like Hyderabad. The metro should help with the situation though.

Food: The Citrus Cafe provides a breakfast buffet that is wholesome and delicious. Furthermore, you may request a dish if you want and they will cook it up for you. You won't have a grumpy morning here that's for sure.

Facilities: Rooftop Pool - Awesome. WiFi - You probably won't need the paid one since the free WiFi works good enough. Elevators - Fine. Also, there is a Gym and a Spa available here.

All in all a great stay. The whole month went by without any problems or hindrances to my routine. Would definitely recommend this place.",5.0,July 2019,business,Faizan Khan,4,,"Hyderabad, India",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

I had decided to celebrate my son's second birthday this year at Lemon Tree premier hitec city and got a very good deal, thanks to Varsha and Bornali for their proactiveness and support in providing the hall at last minute although they had tentative booking for the same day. The managers Ranjan, Madhu and the chefs Hashmi, Anand and the entire team were always on their toes . Front office manager Iqbal, Azhar and the reception team were very helpful in providing me the rooms as per my requirement. The rooms were fantastic with all necessary amenities and housekeeping team lead by Executive housekeeper Sanjeev did a fabulous job. The food and services at the function was sumptous and all my guests enjoyed it. The second day morning breakfast was at Citrus cafe which has elaborate spread and leaves nothing to be asked for. The servers Veda Sridhar and the managers Anjanee and Shashank need special mention. My dosa was fantastic and prepared by Chef Saikrishna at the live counter.

534,Apr 2019,Returned Back!!,"Hotel: Lemon Tree Premier, Hi-tech City
Month of Travel: March 2019
Visit Type: Solo/ Business Travel

It was a great feeling to return to lemon tree premier. While Initially, I was a part of Lemon Tree, this time I entered the Hotel as a guest. The front desk staff was decent enough to make my check in experience quick and hassle-free. I met one of the trainees who helped me with my luggage while going to the allocated room.

Pros:
Familiar ambiance
Helpful and friendly housekeeping staffs
Courteous in room dining staffs
Decent enough Buffet options
Oh Yes, the ceiling fan

Cons:
Smell in the recycled water used for flush
Damaged bedside lamp – No switch/missing button

I felt the prices of the IRD menu little above and overpriced. Considering my experiences at different hotels, I somehow felt that the menu is overpriced – No hard feelings, this is just what I felt. The best interaction – Yeah – My especially abled friend who delivered my IRD order was very polite and courteous and I would say that was the best interaction.

Overall, I am very much satisfied with my stay and would definitely like to return to this hotel on my next visit to Hyderabad.",4.0,March 2019,business,Adirups,210,23,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",5.0,4.0,,,,4.0

563,Feb 2019,I can write a book about my wonderful journey with the lemon tree premier Hitech City,"It’s been six years my journey started with lemon tree in 2013. Many people write many reviews but very few reviews come from the heart and I m one among them to write it. I m Dr Elchuri Raja Ranjith ,An Ayurveda doctor practising in Hyd since 15 long years. I have to mention few things and about few people in lemontree hitech city who are now no more treated as staff by me. They are very good friends of mine. The hospitality is so good which make me visit the Slounge in Mlevel atleast thrice a week since 6 years. A stress buster Slounge with a small pool table is always a great hangout with friends. I particularly like to mention few names here. Mr Madhu the manager of Slounge is very guest friendly and very few hotels have such people as managers who are not arrogant and with no attitude. Very happy for this person because I very well know that such people will take lemon tree hotels to next higher levels. It would be a mistake if I don’t mention the names of Mr Sagar,Mr Teja and Mr Siddharth who are very guest friendly... thanks a lot sagar and teja for making me feel so comfortable. It is because of you people I always have social gatherings at our Slounge and can’t even imagine to visit any other place. Another thing is restaurants become best from good and better levels because of good chefs and I m proud to say that Mr Irshad and Mr Sabir are among the best chefs of lemon tree. Discovered many delicious dishes which are not part of the menu and it’s purely their experience and talent which plays a major role. Thank you chefs. Finally last but not least Lemon tree management is one of the best managements I have seen who offer jobs to Deaf and dumb people like few KFCs does. I m proud of you people for giving opportunity to such people. Habeeb, khaja, khadeer and Venkateswar are few among such people working here with whom I have a very good friendly bonding.... finally thanks a lot Lemon tree management of hitech city for gifting me many happy evenings since six long years.... cheers....

575,Feb 2019,Sarv Guna sampann,"It is a FANTASTIC property.

Location: Located at hitech city, the technical hub of hyderabad. It’s a busy area, with restaurants and shops like Karachi bakery, Burger King, and IKEA near-by. Cabs and auto rickshaws are easily available. Two lemon tree brand’s properties - premiere, and red fox are next to each other in the same property. Overall, it’s a good location.

Ambience and check-in: The hotel is beautiful with a huge, sophisticated lobby. It has Lemon tree’s signature citrusy smell which is very refreshing. They have little T-shirts, with creative and funny ideas and lines printed on them. These make a very interesting read. The check-in was smooth.

Room: The rooms are spacious, clean, and well lit. They have all modern facilities you would expect and need - nice clean beds, hygienic washrooms, toiletries, iron and iron board, TV, kettle, mini refrigerator, etc.

Food: The food is very, very delicious. Their buffet meals are served at the Citrus cafe. The buffet spread is good, and the staff is attentive. They have 2 other restaurants - Republic of Noodles and Kebabs theatre. Republic of noodles is a pan-Asian restaurant, and their food is very authentic and tasty. They have a lot of variety too, and the ambience is very inviting.
Kebabs theatre is an Indian food restaurant, decorated in Bollywood theme. It looks very creative. The special quality about this restaurant is that it is handled completely by specially abled people. The food is very sumptuous.

Staff: this is the BEST quality of Lemon tree brands. Their staff is warm, with an eye for detail. They go out of their way to make sure every guest has a pleasant stay.

Mr. Corbett - the General Manager is a gem of a person. He is such a charming gentleman, who is very keen and sincere in his work. In spite of being super busy (he is the regional head of all lemon tree properties in Hyderabad), he found the time to greet and interact with guests. We got the opportunity to interact with him, and he is so knowledgable, and so humble. It was a real pleasure meeting him. There was a particular personal incident, in which he even made the effort to call us personally and leave a voice message to help us out. Truly, an asset to lemon tree.

Mr. Sanjiv - the Housekeeping executive, is such a wonderful person. He takes feedback very positively. This fine gentleman too helped us in a very great way during our stay at Hyderabad, even after we had checked out of the hotel. He is very sweet and goes out of his way to make sure the guests are comfortable. Please meet him while you’re there. He is a fantastic person. We informed him we were going to Tirupati later on. And he made sure our stay there was comfortable as well.

Mr. Anjanee - the F&B manager is such an enthusiastic food lover, he makes sure the guests enjoy the food in his restaurants. He attends to guests, discusses food and flavour with them, and acts as the perfect host to the guests in his restaurants. Because of him, we got to taste one of the best thai green curry at republic of noodles. and he is very knowledgeable about international cuisines as well.

Also, a special mention for Chefs from Republic of Noodles and kebabs theatre. Thank you so much for amazing food.

583,Jan 2019,"Nice lobby, but otherwise quite an average hotel","When you arrive you are greeted with a large and impressive lobby which makes you think the hotel may be something special, despite its lower price point.

But it does not live up to those expectations. The rooms are acceptable but basic, and the one I stayed in had poor noise insulation from the main road outside, so I was glad to have earplugs with me.

The facilities are good, but nothing particularly special, and sadly I found that the room service food was quite poor.

What bothered me the most was the fairly chaotic nature of the hotel. I had pre-booked airport transfers, and while the one that took me TO the hotel was fine, it took several phone calls, a visit to the desk and a lot of confusion to confirm that the return one was in place.

However, most of the staff were friendly and attentive, and overall I thought this place was fine. It just wouldn’t be my first choice if I were returning here on business.",3.0,January 2019,business,philreid,21,53,"Glasgow, United Kingdom",,,,,,

1. Clean rooms. They have daily housekeeping and would provide the basic needs. I once saw them when I went back mid-day and they were all smiling and accommodating. Mr. Rajasekhar is mute but he was polite and friendly and made sure the room was clean before I left.

2. Republic of Noodles. This restaurant is amazing! They have good food at reasonable prices. Really friendly staff and always smiling. I look forward to dining here again when I am back.

3. Citrus Cafe. Breakfast will be served here everyday and it had enough selection for international guests. They keep the local Indian breakfast but provide options for others. The lady from the cafe reception would always be helpful and smiling.

4. Sustainability initiatives. I like their concept of using recycled water in the toilet flush. It doesn't smell. And I know that I am not using fresh water to flush. Toiletries are also provided on an as needed basis. Which is really good.

I would definitely consider staying here again in the future if I get the opportunity to travel back to Hyderabad. Not to mention its proximity to the office where I work. And they give corporate discounts.",4.0,January 2019,business,Rina P,4,,"Bulacan, Philippines",,,,,,

The housekeeping staff (Mr. S. Rajasekhar) was extremely courteous and great with their work. Similarly, the staff at the Citrus restaurant was very friendly and swift with their service.

One thing I wasn’t happy with was my experience checking in to the hotel. Although my reservation was from 25th Nov, I was going to check in only on 26th at 6:30am. I emailed the hotel and let them know of my plans and even sought their assistance with airport transfers. However, my reservation was canceled as a ‘No show’ despite having notified. Then on 27th I received a call asking what time was I checking out. When I mentioned that I am supposed to be here till 28th, they said they had made an error in my reservation and set the checkout date as 27th. It was then extended by amother day.

No way - what a real foodie wants is finger-licking food that has imagination and when he/ she goes next time he/ she gets the same thing again and again with the same flavour, taste and quality.

So - being a foodie I have visited many restaurants in big hotels and I have been mostly disappointed in quality and taste of food and mostly in consistency but this small restaurant ""Kabab Theatre"" in Lemon Tree premier at Hitech City Hyderabad is absolutely different. This team stands taller to any restaurant I have gone to. Not only they take pride in quality of food served their consistency is amazing.
Had visited yesterday 18 Nob 2018 with a German friend and two of us had Raan Punjabiyan Di Shaan, Priyanka Loves it (grilled fish), Mutton Dum Ki Biriyani,Mutton Rogan Josh and Malai Kulfi. Both of us went crazy and ate our hearts out as every dish was super and tasty.

To top it all it is real value for money.

I had requested for a car to fetch me from the airport and the driver was on time, professional and helpful.

When the hotel staff realised that I had a bad cough, they went out of their way to make me feel better. Mr. Bhaskar Mandal in particular takes special care of each and every guest to ensure that their stay at The Lemon Tree is comfortable.

The hotel has several restaurants and a bar. Citrus cafe serves the breakfast but is available for ala carte orders too. My favorite is the Kebab theatre which serves amazing Indian food!

I think the best part about this hotel is providing job opportunities for people with special needs in hearing. I saw how they are empowered to work doing various roles in the hotel. The most interesting was in Kebab Theatre where they have a booklet for sign language that helped us communicate with our waiter.

773,Aug 2018,Average hotel and stay - could be so much better,"I was scheduled to stay at the Lemon Tree in Hitec City for a 3 week business trip. Unfortunately I had to check out early due to a very large amount of students coming to the hotel and quite frankly being teenagers, making lots of noise, shouting to one another from opposite ends of the floor and having little gatherings in their rooms until a minimum of 3am - which is not ideal when you are next to one of those rooms with a 04.30am rise for work. I escalated this to reception, for which I was moved to another room, but alas, this room was on the 11th floor had 2 windows, with the bed more or less next to one of them so it was constant traffic and horn tooting all night long. After 3 nights of no sleep, I had to move somewhere else and I am so glad that I did - The Westin is excellent. I'm sorry I didn't book there initially.

The positives of the hotel:
- Great staff, particularly the staff in Citrus restaurant, they are fantastic. Special mention to Vedavyas and Anil, superb. Reception staff a little stand offish, well apart from 2 gents, they were excellent
-Good gym which I used a lot in 2 weeks of my stay
-Great food and choice in the Citrus buffet lunch/dinner
-The location, which was ideal for work purposes

The negatives of the hotel:
-The rooms are outdated, walls could be doing with some freshening up, lots of scuffs and marks
-The rooms smell of damp. You don't smell it so much going in and out of the room, but for me, I smelt it on my clothes, quite unpleasant
-It is next to a very busy road and the noise of the traffic is unbearably loud, even with earplugs. Truly, it never stops.

It classes itself as a 4 star hotel, it is not. The reception area is pretty something, really open and beautiful, but the rooms are not. They need improvement to be a 4 star hotel. My time was just okay at the hotel, I just focused on work more than anything else. Sadly when one thing went wrong, a number of things went wrong and that's when you need Managers to step in and resolve - didn't quite happen. Tip going forward, focus on your other guests not just excessive numbers of students to fill up occupancy .",3.0,August 2018,business,Trixie5,14,31,"Scotland, United Kingdom",,4.0,3.0,,2.0,

775,Aug 2018,Average stay in heart of HITEC city,"I had a week at the Lemon Tree while on a business trip. My stay was adequate in what is a well priced hotel that met my needs for a shortish stay.

With a good location in HITEC City, it was easy for me to get to and from the office. I’m not sure how or if that will be impacted by the newly built IKEA.

The room could do with freshening up. Apart from to sleep I was rarely there so this did not overly bother me but the walls were heavily scuffed. This did not leave a good opening impression.

Breakfast was fairly varied with the offering more catered for Indian guests. I guess that is to be expected considering where you are! There is the opportunity for you to request items should they not be served at the buffet.

I didn’t use any of the facilities but the gym and swimming pool both looked of good quality.

I had stayed at the WestInn on my last visit and whilst I appreciate there’s a difference in price, should I visit Hyderabad again then I would head back there.",3.0,August 2018,business,ChazzaM,63,28,"Watford, United Kingdom",,,,,,

My first stay here and I found the service rather good. Staff were friendly and very responsive.

The rooms are similar to other Lemon Tree properties I've stayed at - not sure why this hotel is called Premier (other than location). Rooms are small but comfortable and most amenities are provided or a phone call away. The desk is a bit cluttered! View was nothing great.

The 11th floor boasts of an open swimming pool. There is a decent gym on the 9th. Internet was good.

The Citrus is where breakfast and other meals are served. Found breakfast buffet to be sufficient. The buffet dinner was also decent. Enough choices and tasty. There is a bar - Slounge - on the 1st floor which is rather expensively priced!

It is one of the few hotels within walking distance to my office in the HiTech City area. It is excellent value for money, costing USD 75 for the room with half board (buffet breakfast and dinner) with taxes included. I love the excellent gym and very clean swimming pool, and also the very highly rated Republic of Noodles on-site restaurant that serves Pan Asian (Thai, Singaporean, Malaysian, Cambodian and other) food. The buffet breakfast and dinner is also great, with lots of Indian and international choices, which is especially suitable for a foreigner like myself who cannot eat spicy food.

The hotel also has a tour desk where you can book the hotel taxi for 4-hour or 8-hour packages to tour nearby places like the Charminar and Golkonda Fort, and also take you to any place you want to go. It costs less than 2000 rupees (USD 30) for an 8-hour booking, which is cheaper and more flexible than almost any other tour booking that you can find on the Internet.

The only drawback of this hotel is the location - for people who like night life after work, there are no big shopping malls nearby. You will need to take a taxi like Uber to the bigger shopping malls like InOrbit Mall.",5.0,July 2018,business,Chye C,24,14,,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0

I had hosted my daughters engagement ceremony at Lemon Tree Hotel Electronic City Bangalore two years back and have stayed in the property a couple of times after that, remaining a happy guest ever since.

A no-fuss welcome at Hitec City Hyderabad, into the familiarity of the typical furniture and furnishings of the lobby and room immediately made us feel completely ‘at home’.
What touched my heart yet another time was beyond the excellent housekeeping, the prompt room service and delicious food.
I have been massively impressed all along by the fact that for a decade now, the Lemon Tree Hotel Company has been hiring people who are differently abled and since around five years it has been hiring people from economically and socially weak backgrounds as well.
It was impossible not to be happy and heartened on witnessing the the complete coordination and casual camaraderie among the staff. The alphabetic chart Indian Sign at every table is very heartwarming.
I must mention a few names here...
Khaja Khader who attended us at the buffet breakfast in Citrus Cafe and during dinner at Kebab Theatre is specially blessed with intuitiveness and is an absolutely admirable gentleman who won our hearts.
Akram from Housekeeping was very attentive and prompt.
Bornali who was managing the Citrus Cafe during breakfast was extremely cordial and sweet.

This was especially true for those working in the room service teams and food serving jobs (at the cafe, at breakfast), and I was pleased to see that even those who have got these disabilities were working at the hotel.

833,May 2018,5 weeks in Hyderabad,"I have stayed at the Lemon Tree Premier in HITEC city for 5 weeks. The hotel itself is an oasis of calm, friendly and eager service. The location area is undergoing lots of building work to support the new IT-centric installations - new buildings and roads. In addition to the hotel's superb restaurants, there are also a number of them up and down the road (be careful crossing the road).

There are shops in Madhapur, and a number of ATMs around. Best shop location is the Inorbit Mall. Take an auto (motor-rickshaw) - decide on price FIRST. I may be paying over the odds but I pay 100R to get there and 200R to get back (long way round on the one-way system). Don't pay more. Alternatively, if you have mobile data, download the Ola app for fixed price transport.

Inorbit has lots of high-end shops, but also restaurants, cinema and a supermarket. Beer and wine can be obtained from one of the outlets inside the supermarket.

Local sights include Golconda Fort and Old Hyderabad.

My room is very comfortable, spacious, AC is great, 2 pieces of laundry included per day. Tea/coffee making, etc, clothes iron. Limited closet space, but sufficient for my needs. Shower is hot and powerful :) There is a great gym, beautiful rooftop pool and a classy spa.

One of the great things about this hotel is that they employ a significant number of hearing and speech impaired people, so you will see many staff communicate in Indian Sign Language, especially in the restaurant and housekeeping sections.

One of my fondest memories of this trip is when chef Sambhav and his team (Sabeer, Irshad and Ravinder) walked me though the steps to create chicken tikka masala in the Kebab Theatre kitchen.

855,Apr 2018,A good hotel,"I stayed here for three weeks on a business trip to Hyderabad. I was on the 11th floor (room 1112) and it was a spacious room, the bathroom was a bit on the small side but ok.
The bar has a relaxed atmosphere and the Republic of Noodle restaurant has some brilliant Asian food and is worth a visit even if you are not staying in the hotel.
One of the best things I have ever seen in all of the hotels I have ever stayed in is that the Kebab Theatre restaurant is staffed by hearing and/or speech impaired staff. The guys also work in the bar when it gets busy. It’s the very first time I have seen it and shows the hotel chain is a forward thinking company. Much kudos for this idea 👍
I did have a problem with the hotel car I had booked to take me to the airport. The night before I was due to leave I went to check the reservation for the hotel car. The staff at reception could not find any reservation for me even though it was written down two nights before. I asked to speak with the duty manager because I was starting to get angry. The manager arrived and check the reservation book but couldn’t find the reservation. He assured me that he would take care of it and find out what happened to make sure it didn’t happen again. The duty manager said that due to the mix up that the hotel would pay for the hotel car to take me to the airport. I thought that was a nice gesture of good will.

865,Apr 2018,Not a great Experience,"Lemon tree in Hyderabad used to be good, they were very good in other places as well, I have stayed in multiple properties of them. But some of my experiences have been disappointing. I will just a summarize my experience with Hyd property. I checked late in the evening and I was tried hence decided to go for room service. I ask the chef is he can make any custom south Indian subzi for which he told me that they are too busy to customize and I will have to go with what they have in the menu. I did not like the ones in the room service menu (because of very limited options). The next day morning when I had breakfast, I found a stone which was the size of a peanut and it hurt my teeth as well. I handed over the same to the chef and they told that they will investigate and get back, it is 3 months now and there has been no reply from them yet, not that I was expecting one. My point is how a place like this can miss such huge stone in the food? What sort of quality control they have? Why they are using such low quality ingredients to make food for guests? If they had washed the stone would got caught in the process (it happens at every home). Why such a simple process not in place? After this incident I never had food in the hotel, there was a Signature restaurant called Simply South which was available nearby and I ate there all the time (it is a fantastic place btw). I checked out early morning around 6 am, went to the restaurant and asked for south Indian coffee and they told me that it was not ready, it was perhaps the last straw. I have stopped staying in their properties after this experience, probably complacency has set in",2.0,January 2018,couple,GHK04,1,,"Chennai, India",,1.0,2.0,,2.0,

One thing which I did not understand is why are these not following government rules and scamming customers.

927,Jan 2018,Best of Hyderabad is here,"2 weeks in Lemon tree
I have stayed in several hotels in Hyderbad now and this is hands down the best.
Bottom Line, I will be back.

The good points:
- The senior level staff are very helpful (Head of Food and Beverage and Housekeeping especially)
- Nothing is perfect, and when it is not you tell the staff and they will correct it.
- The food is great. If you booked a stay here without a breakfast package, you are missing out.
- The area is clean and well maintained.
- 24 hour service is available so if you want food at 3 am or a some soft drinks at 5 am .... its there for you.

Areas to improve:
- Money was always a problem... The front desk promised to have money for me, and never delivered. I asked again on another day and they had another excuse, and another day and they could only give me 200US in local currency.
- Reservations staff were slow to respond, didn't respond to a couple of my emails and provided inconsistent answers.

Manish from the Reservation team helped me with my early check-in as our flight landed early by 8am. Thanks to Nikita & Aditya, also from the reservation who helped during my bookings and queries. The front-desk was very welcoming and so was the security at the entry point.

Our room was 210 at Level 2, with the city view. Quite a spacious room, reason why I chose after staying in Hotel Formula 1 in my last visit. The rooms were clean, amenities provided were all good. The only thing I found missing in the room was a Clock! Otherwise it had everything. They still don't have license to serve liquor in the room, but you can buy and have it yourself. I enquired about it since I checked in 31/12/2017 and we wanted to celebrate the New Year's Eve in our room. Nevertheless, the stay and the property was indeed beautiful.

The staff in Citrus were the most humble and courteous. They would take care of your breakfast table, even though it was buffet breakfast. They would suggest the food or ask for drinks if they see it missing from your table. I loved this gesture, as I travel a-lot and have never found any staff so caring in a buffet plan. Thanks to all of them at the Citrus. S-Lounge was good too for recreation. They've a pool table and karoake and we indeed had our share of fun in the S-Lounge playing pool. The in-room dining service was good and I loved each of them, though the price was indeed exorbitant. The free wi-fi is just for one device and is comparatively slow, possibly because they've plans for upgrade by paying.

The stay was indeed wonderful and we had a beautiful good time shopping around. The hotel is well located at the Hitech City Road, close to all major shopping malls and major Tech Co Offices.",4.0,January 2018,couple,JoyrajWaikhom,63,14,"Kolkata, India",5.0,4.0,,,4.0,

They both made efforts to understand what we wanted to have and make their best to get it for us. Chef Krishna understands what the problem is and rectifies to the best.

House keeping was slow, had to call twice and wait for about 15 minutes for an extra blanket.

Front desk don't make any effort to accommodate any requests or changes, we were on a MAP and wanted to have lunch the day we were checking out rather than eat dinner the day we arrived. Which is accepted without any problem at other places but here they said it is not possible. The staff does not show any interest in accommodating the guest, won't even try.

980,Nov 2017,Pleasant 2 weeks of stay,"I stayed for 2 weeks at Lemon Tree Premier for my business trip to Hyderabad. Did not have a high expectation of services, but i was impressed by the good quality from the very start when the hotel provided an airport shuttle to transport me from the airport to the hotel.

The staff are friendly and they are willing to make conversation along the way to make the guest feel comfortable. The hotel exemplifies the exact definition of Indian hospitality in many ways.

The hotel room is also well maintained, and they usually clean the rooms in the early afternoon. If you are staying in the hotel room till afternoon, be sure to put the Do Not Disturb outside your door as they will keep knocking on the door to ensure you are doing ok in your room.

The hotel also offers a one day (8 hour) private car service to take you around Hyderabad and I was happy to have a good chauffeur who was good at making conversations happen (he speaks English very well)
and ensuring everything went well. If you are in Hyderabad and are putting up at Lemon Tree Premier, please look for this chauffeur - Habib.

As for the downsides, it would have been great if there was more variety in the breakfast buffet as it seems to be more or less the same variations everyday. The security checks were also a bit of hassle as every guest returning to the hotel needs to be checked thoroughly although that is understandable since almost all places in Hyderabad require this security check, whether you are a local or foreigner there.

Nonetheless, it was a good stay, and if you are doing business in the HITEX area of Hyderabad, this is definitely a good place to stay!",4.0,November 2017,business,darkhonour,60,5,"Singapore, Singapore",,,,,,

I again got an opportunity to stay for a month in June, this year. We frequently used to hop on to Lemon Tree for drinks and foods. During each such event, it used to be a great experience. They have a highly hospitable staff that listen to your needs and are eager to any customization. I would want commend Mr. Vivek Vikram Singh (the F&B manager) for his exceptionally great personality. At each occasion he stood out as extremely gregarious ,courteous and humble. He always went overboard to ensure my friends and I were well taken care of. Citrus Cafe and the pub had been our regular choice for hanging around on most days. I must agree the pull factor was Vivek.

Now after relocating to Hyderabad, last week, I again visited Lemon Tree and had lunch at Citrus Cafe. Great experience, once again.

Vivek has also been the go to guy for accommodation needs as well, whenever I host any of my friends and relatives to Hyderabad.

985,Nov 2017,Unpleasant experience @ Lemon Tree,"To the point- Check in time is 2 PM, I reached the hotel at 2:25 PM, after 5 mins of waiting time, I was informed that my room was getting cleaned, approx time was 10 mins waiting time. After 15 mins, I walked up to the Reception to check on the room, was informed another 10 mins delay. After 10 mins, walked up, was told 5 Mins delay.
Finally checked in at around 3 :05 PM. All this while, I had to take the trouble to walk up and inquire about my room.
Upon entrance, I realized that there was some construction work going on somewhere near, so had the constant sound of loud hammering. The hotel staff had no idea of the source. Finally got a different room, so add another 20 mins. I finally got a room after almost 1 hour.
Cut to the food- Order chicken tikka sandwich - expected a club sandwich, got a regular bread size. The ingredients used to prepare the sandwich made it taste so oily, greasy and spicy. Got an upset stomach immediately.
Quantity of in dining dishes was also less, compared to the quantity offered by other hotels of the 4 star grading.
Breakfast spread was good.
In short one of the worst experiences in my life at a hotel of this star rating.
Other colleagues who were staying with me had also faced similar issues.
Will never visit this hotel ever again.

986,Nov 2017,Better hotels around,"I generally like staying at lemon tree properties. You always know what to expect.
May the reason why i was not very satisfied with my stay. Bed was clean, room was airy with a view of the city, however the age clearly showed, with a dirty couch and a very uncomfortable chair at the work desk. The bath was missing a rain shower, again in my opinion should be a norm for a 3-4 star hotel. The buffet breakfast was good, with a decent spread of items which seemed cooked fresh.

The front desk as always was pathetic, were completely unaware of our arrival (booking done months ago) were not sure of number of rooms or guests took several minutes to find the email confirmation. I have checked in to hotels in 5 minutes flat. And I hardly get amused whenever I see people fiddling at the front desk, especially when I travel for work.
However, as always I appreciate lemon tree management for employing ""differently-abled "" staff members. As i always find them to be very cheerful and always ready to help. The gentleman at the front desk who took care of my luggage at the clock room was one such member of the staff.

989,Nov 2017,Incompetent staff. Terrible customer service,"I paid for a meeting room for business conference. I specifically requested for big u shaped or oval big table that could seat 15 people. I was promised a big table and was also sent a picture of the table as confirmation and along with the price quote. I had offer an which was priced far less from another hotel but they had smaller round tables and people would have to be split up so I opted for lemon tree which offered the big table. Guests for the meeting traveled from various towns/cities and to my shock i learned that instead of the big table they promised the room had many small round tables and this completely disrupted the meeting and was a big embarrassment.

When I contacted the banquet staff I received a lame email stating of please accept my apologies. I requested them to discount the bill for the room component but they charged me full amount despite the flawed arrangement. Any reasonable fair minded business like hotel would have charged me for the food served and discounted or written off the price of the room. But not the unprofessional lemon tree. They feel entitled to take full money from client without having delivered the product they promised. To m that is a rip off. The staff are incompetent in their work but competent in covering each others mistakes.

The level of unprofessionalism is so high that I did not get the receipt of the charges till I requested them to send me a copy. The management needs to learn that projecting an international image and having a big building can only take them so far in hospitality industry.

Some nice touches such as some of the staff they employ being deaf and dumb but supplying cards to assist in sign language or to convey what you want and also a quirky toilet on the mezzanine floor where the bar is that highlights the move to discourage drink driving but done in a novel way.

My request with the hotel house keeping staff for laundry and request for in room tea requirement, I was surprised to see two smartly dressed people in front of my room. A courtesy discussion reveals that both of them couldnt speak and hear. Its emotional situation, as i too have a special child who would converse with people in a similar fashion.
Spoke to the front desk while checking out. it was really heartening to note that the hotel employs children with the special needs and are paid at par with that of other normal staff. Hats off Lemon Tree and God Bless You. You are doing very noble duty along with business.

1000,Oct 2017,OK - But not four stars....,The hotel room was clean but bear in mind it is fairly basic for a four star rating - but has all the facilities you need. The bath in the bathroom was badly marked and there were issues with hot water at times. The buffet was OK but not everything was visibility clean in the citrus cafe. The staff were helpful and it is good to see disabled people working together with other colleagues - they were all friendly and enagaged. On the plus side the swimming pool was good for a proper swim.

1012,Sep 2017,Proudly ‘Different’,"Great location being close to all the major BPO hubs. Well maintained interiors and reasonably good restaurants.

The room is fairly large and designed for functionality. If I had to offer constructive criticism it would be for two aspects - (i) the mattress sank because it’s time to replace and rotating the sides increases longevity and (ii) offer to place buckets to save water. I would immediately opt for this.

I rate this hotel chain and this property high because of their speech and hearing impaired staff. They are lovely, very solicitous, attentive and as capable as any other staff.

They set the restaurants, lobby, lifts and corridors alight with their bright cheery smiles and demeanour 😬

I'm glad I saw the differently abled being given the opportunity to alter their lives for the better

To me, its always been a preferred 3-Star when I am not staying 5/4 Star Hotel. This property is strategically located at Hi-tech City, Hyderabad and can be looked upon by the persons working in Hi-tech City/ Gachibowli and near by areas.

Rooms are quite decent with ambience what we expect out of a 3 star property. Food is at its best and one can order anything from the menu without wondering how it would be.

I shall give 1 star less for the service we see during the BF time. The staff goes crazy in order to serve their customers. May be they falling short of the personnel or need to manage in a more organised manner.

One thing which I really like and appreciate about Lemon Tree Hotels is the employment they provide to ""DIFFERENTLY ABLE PEOPLE"". I was so happy to see them work and i feel for such persons this is the best fit. Check out the 'National Award' certificate attached herewith on the same. KUDOS !!!

I just wish this message reaches out to millions to know how we can accommodate such sweet people around us so that they earn and feel respected.

Food was exceptional. The team at the Hotel needs a pat on their back for being on their toes and making sure all guests are well taken care.

All the service people went out their way to make the stay comfortable and house-cleaning did a good job on the junior suite I had rented, and the breakfast food was excellent. Even though its in the middle of Hitech City on the main road, outside noise is minimal and you can get lots of cabs for local travel. There are two TV's in the suite and the bed is firm and nice but the pillows are too soft. Anyway I would highly recommend staying there, because I plan on doing the same next time I am in Hyderabad.

The drive from the Airport to the hotel was tiring considering the evening peak hour traffic. The hotel sure is located in the midst of the maddening chaos. The view of the city at night is worth it. The illuminated roads, buildings, especially the fly over, gives it a very starry look.

The staff was courteous, and the room neat and tidy. The food was also decent, wouldn't want to order anything Mediterranean though.

Used the spa / salon services, not anywhere close to what it should have been. The spa / salon is understaffed, putting so much burden on the existing staff that they can't get anything done peacefully, it almost felt like getting a pedicure done in the first class waiting room.

1033,Aug 2017,Memorable stay,"This is our second visit to this hotel. We spent 5 days in Lemon tree premier hotel. We were a group of 27 members on a science study tour from Maldives to Hyderabad. As we enter the hotel lobby, the fragrance of lemon is refreshing. The rooms are very neat and the room service is excellent. Never had a complaint from any member of the group about house keeping. The food is awesome.I think the food at Citrus cafe is one of the selling points of the hotel, if not the only point.
The front desk and staff are very courteous and helpful and are always at your service. The appointment of differently abled people in the hotel is a great initiative.
Mr. Ali in the Citrus cafe' is very enthusiastic to serve the best food to his guests. He made sure that our group had a memorable experience of Hyderabadi food.

Scope to improve:
We felt that there is a little lack of coordination between the front desk and the citron cafe about our group's food plan as they had to look into the bills and then take us in. This could have been informed before hand.

Some of the students very much liked the bath soap provided by the hotel. They were really sad to learn that the soaps are not available for sale in the shops and I requested the front desk to provide a few soaps to the students as a compliment. The answer was a plain NO. Maybe it is the hotel policy or a rule but i felt that they could have done better in this regard.

These trivial matters can be ignored.

Will sure visit this same place next year with a new batch of students.

1049,Jul 2017,"Business hotel, food is great!","I stayed there for 2 weeks. Would like to start with few positive points:
- Housekeeping team is professional and understands your needs. When one is there for 2 weeks, smallest of their needs are taken care.
- special mention to the tailor there Srinivas and asst. manager Shubham, I had a pant to be altered in priority and they went out of their to get it done
- Sarita from Food and Beverage and Chef of the coffee shop were helpful. Chef would make sure I got the fresh juice before I asked for it.
- Breakfast spread is good

But there were a few points which can be looked at:
- hot water is a major concern in the room. Every time I had to call someone from engineering to fix it.
- not everyday newspaper is delivered to the room
- the live station at breakfast was bad. Few times they got my order wrong even when the restaurant wasn't busy. No one likes raw eggs
- while taking coffee to my room, some service person called me out loudly saying you are not allowed to take coffee upstairs. If one has to inform, do that politely, after all you are in service industry.

1052,Jul 2017,"Oasis in Desert and that is Kabab Theatre in Lemon Tree Premier, Hyderabad","My review needs a short background to be given so that readers can understand the relevance why the title I gave to my review.
I moved to Hyderabad in Apr 2016 after taking an opportunity here which was a difficult decision as I was to move alone - however one consideration was very much important in that decision - and that is stories of food and awesome Biriyani one read and talked about when anyone mentioned Hyderabad; as for foodie like me it was a major input.
For almost many months, I tried every so called famous joint for that special Hyderabadi biriyani as well as other stuff and for me it was one setback after another. I visited every possible so called famous name to have one good meal where one can see heart and taste of Hyderabad - but got nothing more than dejection everywhere.
Then one of my close friends was visiting Hyderabad and we planned to meet for dinner. However, the timing was such that we could not have traveled a lot of distance for food so nearest place was Lemon Tree Premier. I was not so sure about food and called up the Chef Kumar Sambhav (Yes the name sounded like a name from Indian Mythology :)) and he suggested that I better visit Kabab Theatre. I did share my apprehensions but decided to visit anyways.
It is a restaurant with decent ambience, designed with Bollywood theme and every item from chairs, to menu had a touch of Bollywood.. Luckily for us Chef was present there and made it a point to request him to change my opinion about food in Hyderabad.
We ordered for Raan- Punjabiyan Di shaan (A marinated+cured+cooked full rear tender leg of lamb), Grilled Sol fish (forgot the name of dish), Hyderabadi Biriyani (mutton) (named Mast Kalandar Handi Ke Andar) as well as a chiken tikka. And we were pleasantly surprised with the quality and taste.
All items had not only magical taste but also they were reflecting pride taken by chef and staff in each preparation. All portions were also of very decent volume. The Raan was nothing like I ever had before - it was melting in the mouth and bursting into volcano of taste. Both Chicken tikkas as well as Grilled fish were also amazing, very well marinated, rightly grilled and were juicy.
Then came the Biriyani. I was most sceptical about it, as at least in ten so called brand ambassadors of Hyderabadi biriyani had failed me by serving me dry rice and inside that poorly cut - dry mutton/ chicken pieces with poor quality salan. Here the Biriyani was something I was longing for so many months. It was an ensemble of well marinated as well as cured pieces of mutton very nicely blending in the rice as well as herbs which were dancing together in our mouth as one along with a thick and well blended mirchi ka Salan - it was just amazing. Both me and my friend were very happy as well as thankful to the Chef Kumar Sambhav for his personal attention.
So story doesn't end here. One of my Muslim friend, who was fasting visited from Australia and on 10th June, I decided to take him to Kabab Theatre for dinner to possibly repeat the experience. I had apprehensions about consistency but never the less I called up Chef Kumar Sambhav again and reached there with a lot of expectations and little apprehension.

We ordered Chiken Haleem, Mast Kalandar Handi Ke Andar, Raan- Punjabiyan Di shaan, ‘Priyanka Loves It’(salmon marinated with lemon zest, ground cumin, coriander and chili flakes), Mutton Rogan Josh (Forgot the name as in the menu), Naan and also the mutton biriyani. Just for two of us it was surely over-eating, but this time I felt that it was even better than previous experience. Every dish was a masterpiece and worth winning master chef competition. We spent almost 1 hour 45 minutes eating and we only had appreciation and gratitude for the chef and his team.
One more important and worth mentioning thing, I observed that many of stewards were deaf and dumb but they were doing an excellent job. This not only speaks volumes of about giving equal opportunities to differently abled person and showing the world that they can work equally efficiently - it is something I would like to appreciate Lemon Tree management for.
So Kabab Theatre for me is a must visit place for foodies. In fact, I recommended it to one of the Canadian family whose one family member is staying in same service apartment I stay in and they were also floored by the quality of food and they realized what real Indian food is like.
I will certainly visit again and again and would recommend this restaurant to anyone who understands and values good food, when visiting Hyderabad.",5.0,June 2017,,Rajeev D,2,2,,,,,,,

They keep surprising me from time to time, by decorating the room with their artistic towel designs or getting a beautiful throne for the Ganpati that was kept in my room. A special thanks to Ashish, Upendra and the entire house keeping team for the sweet gesture.

The food at lemon tree is good. Having stayed here for long, I prefer having home style food and the chefs have been quite supportive. They don’t mind experimenting as well - there was an instance when I asked them to prepare a cake out of Idli for one of my friends and they made a delicious Idli cake. A special thanks to Chef JP and Ankit for the cake and Chef Vikram for the delicious food. The in-room dining staff – Lakshmi, Ranjan, Roni, Shidharth, Lakshman and Rakesh, all have been quite helpful and patient with me while I decide my daily orders. The restaurants (Kebab Theatre and Republic of Noodles) are pretty good and definitely worth a try if one is visiting hyderabad.

However, I would still want the food from Citrus cafe to be more consistent in terms of the taste. The internet speed can be a problem on some days as well.

The service was oustanding from the front desk staff to the senior management. Nothing was ever too much for the staff. Everyone was friendly and helpful.

The food was well prepared and very tasty at the Citrus Cafe. We thoroughly enjoyed our breakfast and all staff were so attentive.

The hotel is clean and fresh and the concierge area is so appealing.

The wifi works very well at a good speed.

This hotel was recommended by Pawan Kumar, one of the employees and we are so glad he did. He helped my mom a few evenings before in another part of town. She was lost, looking for a restaurant and unfortunately did not have rupee currency on her. Pawan noticed her panicking and worried and took it upon himself to assist her. He accompanied her back to her hotel and gave her the money to pay for something to eat and travel back to her hotel. When she met Pawan again, he refused to take the money.
His only concern was that she was safe and sound. Pawan also spoke English, which was really helpful to her. She would therefore like to express her sincere gratitude to him and he should be commended for his efforts in helping a stranger. Yet again, another example of the kindness, compassion and love for humanity shown by the people of India.

We would also like to express our sincere thanks to Bhaskar Mandal, who assisted us when we were on the way to the airport by taking care of an unpleasant situation. Pawan and Bhaskar were knights in shining armour, who take care of visitors to their hotel and to their country. Thank you to Lemon Tree staff for taking such good care of us.

Check in was quite fast with a busy efficient lobby area. We had two adjacent rooms. which were a good size with nice new fittings throughout. The rooms were quiet and security very good, with the need to use swipe cards to access floors and a very good baggage scanning system on entering the hotel.
The lobby staff called an uber vehicle to get to the nearby shopping mall, which was really cheap and worked well. Our return journey cost twice as much in a dodgy auorickshaw.
The rooftop pool area is excellent, although it has no view, with a clean pool and plenty of sitting areas and is very quiet away from any traffic noise.
The corridors have signs asking people to refrain from speaking loudly and annoying the neighbours - a nice thought.
Nearby the hotel has a Burger King, and Karachi Bakery and a few small roadside stalls. The Karachi bakery is fantastic and sells all sorts of cakes, pastries, snacks and drinks. Really well priced as well. Having the bakery close by was brilliant.

The food was so delicious and seems to be prepared with love, well garnished, aromatic and it tasted like heaven. I can still feel the taste in my mouth. Being a vegetarian i felt so good that they have designed the menu in a way that a vegetarian can choose a lot from the menu. I would specially like to thank two charming ladies who served me that evening Ms. Sarita and Ms. Pratima they both were too good always looking around weather do i need something. When i tasted the paneer i could not resist my self to meet the chef who made it for me i asked Ms. Pratima to call the chef once. Then i met those hand who created this delicious dish for me Chef Hashmi and Chef Irshad i would like to thank all of them by my heart. Thank you so much.
All and above my special thanks to the gentleman who suggested me this restaurant Mr. Vikas. "" I asked him which all restaurants do you have. He asked me which cuisine would you prefer sir?

The taste of food was amazing and the service staff was so courteous and seems to be intrested for our needs at each point of time.

One thing to mention is that we come to know that its a Indian hotel chain and they hire specially abled people and we were being told that almost 30 % of staff is filled with these people that took my heart away.

1171,Mar 2017,Nice hotel for a peaceful stay.,"Stayed in a suit. It has nice sit out and comfortable beds with a very large bathroom having wardrobes. Though hotel is located alongside a busy road but still it was all very peaceful. Ambiance of the lobby and restaurant are perfect (didn't visit the bar) However, it was funny to see a bathroom where you keep bath and hand towels bang on a shelf above the WC. Their mini fridge was working as in most other hotels around Hitech city, they hardly cool anything. The mini bar should have liquor also when the items are anyway on chargeable basis only but then I was told by in-room dining that they don't serve liquor in rooms at all. Again very funny that you cant have the comfort of your own room to have a couple of drinks peacefully which was a big negative despite everything. May be they want to encourage guests to bring their own stock(?).
keeping the high tariff in mind, room must have hygiene kit and sewing kit. No replenishments for shower cap or soap are given. Bellboys and drivers make it obvious expecting tips.
Both breakfast and lunch/dinner buffets have excellent spread and quality and the variety is more than enough. But refrain from trying some indian deserts and other stuff like parathas (which was not at all good and having interests in cooking myself I felt like teaching them a little bit but was short of time. Chef can go to a small joint like ""13 Dhaba"" near gachibowli flyover and observe as they are famous for such authentics and cater to lots of IT and ISB crowd).",4.0,March 2017,business,BJS108000,63,33,"Bhopal, India",,4.0,,4.0,,4.0
1172,Mar 2017,Seven Week Stay at Lemon Tree Premier HITEC City,"I normally don't bother to review hotels on business trips, but the Lemon Tree premier HITEC City deserves a mention as it has made a big impression on me.
I am a business traveller from the UK and have been staying here now for seven weeks during Feb and March 2017.

The location is perfect for anyone working in Hitech city. The lobby is fresh and pleasant, with a relaxed and friendly atmosphere.
The staff are all very amiable and helpful and it is worth noting that some of them have disabilities (unable to speak or hear) but the hotel has admirably
employed them to give them a chance in life, and to give them a useful role in the community, and I really like this about Lemon Tree hotels.
Also, around the hotel are interesting metal statues that I understand that the owner of the hotel chain has purchased from local artists in India. They add a very stylish touch to the hotel decor.

The Citrus Cafe breakfast buffet, and the evening buffet, is immense, and you will never tire of the offerings, and many of the hot dishes keep changing daily. In fact I can honestly say that I have never enjoyed hotel food so much before on any business trip. Do ask the waiter for a fresh nan bread in the evening and it will be baked for you immediately in a real tandoor oven in the kitchen.

The Pool is outdoors on the roof, 20m x 10m and super clean, surrounded by trees and plants. As for the the gym or spa salon or business centre I have not had to use them, so cannot comment there.

And there is a secret in the rock garden at the side of the hotel that most visitors are probably never aware of - the Skull Rock, one of the famous rock formations of Hyderabad, is in that garden and worth a look.

Credits go to : Sous Chef JP Verma, who regularly inspects the buffet (and the diners!) and checks that everything is up to his high standards,
to my current room cleaner Ranjit (a master of towel origami), my former room cleaner Ranjan, and last but not least, Bikshapathy Yadev from the tea lounge (where I have enjoyed his tasty cool lemon lassi drinks). And there are others too, particularly the servers in the Citrus cafe who are always attentive and helpful, if you need anything at all.",5.0,February 2017,business,Stan_and_Valya,19,,"London, United Kingdom",5.0,5.0,,,5.0,

Spa - Took a deep tissue massage. The therapist gave a good treatment, helped me recover from strained back due to travel. One of the better massages that I have had in the recent past for sure.
Gym - Good and functional - instructors could be more particularly in the evening when more people are there.
Rooms - functional with decent sleep quality. The 30 min wifi was a disappointment - mostly all the hotels that I stay in offer it for free. And the network connectivity to a mobile phone is also poor so that is a challenge.

1236,Feb 2017,A luxurious and memorable Stay,"Who had guessed Lemon Tree Hotels would have grown in leaps and bounds when their Chairman and Managing Director – Patu Keswani, an ambitious and visionary leader started this chain in 2002. Beginning with a humble 49 room hotel in Udyog Vihar, Gurgaon (now called as Gurugram), there was no stopping him. Today, Lemon Tree stands tall as the 3rd largest hotel chain in India at an commendable count of – 40 hotels in 23 cities with 4100 rooms and over 4000 employees.
Lemon Tree Hotels operate in 3 categories to cater to different choices of customers –
Lemon Tree Premier – their upscale brand that falls under the 4 star + category.
Lemon Tree Hotels – aimed at the midscale segment and falls comes under the 3-4 star category.
Red Fox Hotels – the pocket-friendly economy brand that offers 3 star category services.
Curious to discover this refreshing brand I arrived at Lemon Tree Premier, Hitec City on the behest of a friend who coincidently is a Manager in the Hotel. Please note all other staff were unaware of our association and functioned as normally as they do. Impressed by their warm and friendly attitude I decided to write this review.
This upscale hotel situated at a walkable distance from some IT giant companies, does have different categories of rooms and suites available (267 to be precise) to meet the varied needs of - people. I decided to stay in their most popular category room, the Deluxe Room, so as to review it and to help a larger audience. Price range for their rooms (all categories) start from Rs. 6000 (Superior Room) and go up to Rs.20,000 (Presidential Suite) – the best in the city for this category.

Needless to say about their fairly popular business/meeting centers and banquet halls which are almost always booked.

Service and Services:
Any hospitality industry would fall apart without a proper service and Lemon Tree Premier, Hitec City is more than perfect on this point. Right from pick up and till your droppoint, their service is impeccable. Small things like ensuring to reach pickup point before time (when I say before, at-least 30 minutes), ample water bottles (no charges) in your vehicle, king like welcome once you enter the hotel premises, quick check-in and a courteous helping hand that tows your luggage readily ushering you into a bright and cheerful room, swiftly and with no hassles. Most importantly – no staff of theirs, right from the driver to room service staff, even remotely expects a tip from you. This is important, as I have observed in many places that they wait for the tip to be given though they don’t ask verbally, this practice was absent here.

Worth mentioning point – Lemon Tree Hotels are equal opportunity employers. Over 13% of their employees are differently abled. - They are either speech and-hearing- impaired, orthopedically handicapped or have Down’s syndrome. Also, I am told another ~15% are from the economically/socially backward sections of the society. Indeed, a perfect way to help human kind.

The hotel provides complimentary Wifi usage during your stay (time could be limited), roof top swimming pool, super cool gymnasium and a rejuvenating spa- Fresco, make for a relaxing & comfortable stay.

Electronic Safe in every room is a huge plus if you want to store/secure something important.




Quality/Ambiance/Maintenance:
It’s quite common that you are provided with basic morning needs in your bathroom in most of the hotels. This property stands apart by providing best of the quality (mostly Boutique or Sea Salt Spa products) and paying attention to your minute needs. You do also have a handy amenities kit with needles, safety pins, threads et al, just in case you have to reach out to it in your hour of need.
A stay here in a base category room too is quite comfortable. A cosy bed, pleasant view from the window, a mini fridge well stocked with soft drinks and juices and a snack bar to address your hunger pangs (you might have to pay for it depending on your consumption though) along with plush sofas and a study/read/misc table and ergonomic chair for you to use. Have a request beyond the ordinary? Pick the phone and dial the reception. They all are just a call away in accommodating your discerning needs. 🙂
The entire hotel is decorated with metal artifacts sourced from Bastar, a tribal area now in Chhattisgarh. I am told the entire chain promotes Indian art in various forms thereby helping tribals, amateurs and artisans in earning their livelihood. The hotel’s contemporary décor weaves these elements in so beautifully that you wouldn’t know about the Group’s commitment to the cause unless someone told you so. Complimenting this Indianans are the quirky frames with funny jokes and humor spread around hotel/restaurants to invoke the funny bone in you.

Small but cannot go unnoticed: Water used in flush is recycled water, which ensures that there is a significant saving of it. Definitely a good step towards water conservation This hotel is nearly 6 years old and but still feels fresh as a lemon. The lemony fragrance in the public areas and the clean and tidy upkeep ensure the hotel looks as good as new. They regularly upgrade their ambiance and facilities to ensure that they keep up with the changing market trends.



Security:
Room Keys are empowered with RFID tags which ensures that you can access only your floor and not others. A must have feature particularly for the lady travelers. Easy/quick/safe way to lock/unlock your rooms as well.

Restaurants/Cafes:
They have one of the best in-house restaurants in the city. Not only the in-house guests enjoy these delicacies, but also the guests from outside come here just to enjoy these wonderful delights. Below are the restaurants that they have which cater to the different needs and moods of people.

Republic Of Noodles: The Award winning pan- Asian restaurant that serves delectable southeast Asian cuisine at reasonable prices. Detailed review in the blog.

Citrus Cafe: A 24/7 cafe which serves some of the best delicacies in its Breakfast/Lunch and Dinner Buffets and is also open to ala carte 24/7. Detailed review in the link.

Slounge: A recreational bar, which houses games like pool, carrom, dart board and a play station that you can enjoy and hip-hop along with a drink. This is especially recommended for your heart and mind. Detailed review in the link.

Kebab Theatre: Some of the scrumptious Indian Food at your table. Don’t miss this if you are a fan of Kebabs.

Tea Lounge: Strike a friendly conversation over some brewed coffee or sip a cup of Iranian tea while making a formal deal, the choice is yours.
🙂
In-Room Dining: For a lazy brat, it’s just a phone call away. Available 24/7.




Cessation:
Needless to say this is one of the best and memorable stays that I have ever had. While service and food is something which stands out on all aspects, they are equally good in other departments, which made my stay more enjoyable. A special thanks to the Hotel Manager Arun, Asst. Manager Bhaskar, Executive Chef Sambhav, F & B Manager Pankaj, Chakma, Sarita and many others who I missed naming, but their service truly delighted me. There was no single minute of my stay which went boring or unattended to (when asked). A place that should always be on your radar, when looking for a comfortable stay in Hyderabad. I am told service across all their hotels stands the same and service (in my opinion) is the main factor which that makes or breaks your experience. So, kudos to Team Lemon Tree Hotels for delivering a refreshing experience and delight. I shall soon return.",5.0,January 2017,family,Raghav Peddi,359,18,"Hyderabad, India",,5.0,,5.0,,5.0
1237,Feb 2017,Superb,"The room was so good we actually never got up as planned. The bed lighting and the colours and interiors were so good that we just had very well balanced tight sleep. The rooms are spacious and the washroom fitted with separate shower space is very well maintained.

Coming to room service- the management is lightening fast and the service is satisfactory.

Breakfast buffet was very good giving us lot of options.

One of the most exciting thing about Lemon Tree hotel in Hyd- Hitech City or Gachibowli is the swimming pool. The pool in Hitech City is situated on top floor/ roof top with tremendous view of the sky. You shouldn't miss it.

I must appreciate the staff be it front desk, took service, Restaurent manager or floor managers - I couldn't interact with a lot of people but I remember Pankaj one Hotel Management person who took care of us very well. LemonTree HR department is doing a good job in hiring perfect candidates for their job. I've also heard a lot of good reviews about the hotels management and the LemonTree group that they take care of their employees very well which is very important in hotel management industry.

1243,Feb 2017,Great experiance at Lemontree Premier Hyderabad,"Hi ,
This is that best hotels I have experienced so far in terms of comfort , facility , food and hospitality . The stay was pleasant with good food at Citrus cafe offering a great spread of buffet ,with 24/7 house keeping and a clean and neat environment. The whole crew be in at reception , house keeping or cafetaria are awesome in terms of their responsibility , responsiveness and hospitality.

One thing worth mentioning rather the outstanding feature about Lemon tree Premier Hyderabad is their hospitality , you would not see any staff there with out a warm smile and a greeting , makes you feel privileged and comfortable .

I still remember most of the crew names there because of the way they were dealing customers , to name a few , Mr Saroj at reception,Shreedhar and Sarita Citrus cafe managers , Chef saikrishna and alen , Bikash,Pratiba, veda the cafe crew and alll of those crews at citrus cafe who are very much customer oriented are really worth remembering for making my stay a pleasant one .",5.0,January 2017,family,sheejapradeep,1,,"Bengaluru, India",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

An extremely professionaldriver picked us up directly from the airport at a very reasonable be price, and we used the hotel drivers almost each day; all were 5 star, the only name I remember is Aslam?? But all were great.
English speaking staff was an amazing extra; Nandini at the front desk was AMAZING!!! Everyday I had questions and she had answers; all front desk staff were sooo help, respectful and caring. The rooms & housekeeping 6 stars & twice a day serviced our rooms.
The food we more than great; at least 4 restaurants/eating options in the hotel, and whatever we had a taste for found a way to create along with traditional delicious India food. The Restaurant Manger Sarita is a GIFT!!! And her entire staff is wonderful.

1253,Feb 2017,Loved the Citrus Cafe,"I stayed at this Lemon Tree Premier for a week on business travel. The hotel staff at the front desk and the restaurants are top notch.

As an American on his first trip to India, I was worried if I would find food I could eat and people with whom I could speak and understand. My worries were completely in vain so far as the Lemon Tree goes.

I especially enjoyed the Citrus Cafe where I ate almost every meal. The buffet has a great selection that rotates through the week, and I was always able to find something delicious. The majority of the food is Indian or Asian, but there are usually one or two Western dishes available. They also have an A La Carte menu with more Western choices. My last night there, the chef volunteered to prepare a special meal for me, which I really appreciated. The staff at the Cafe never failed to exceed expectations. I would love to give a special thanks to the chef and the girl who seemed to be the manager, but being American, Indian names are difficult for me to remember, especially when spoken and not written... Sorry!

I stayed on the 8th floor, and my room did show a little age in the woodwork. It was clean and nicely appointed, though. My room was on the east side of the building and was facing the 6 lane street. I could hear horns (not very loud) at times with the blinds open, but it was also fascinating to watch the traffic.

There are a lot of channels on the TV, but none of them seem to be HD. There are 15-20 US channels in the 400 range.",5.0,February 2017,business,some_guy_0000,2,1,,,5.0,4.0,4.0,,

The facility is so plush and convenient and the staff are such wonderful human beings! I do not know if I have to commend the recruitment policies, the overall management or the staff themselves!! The service is phenomenal.. right from the Chef Mr. SaiKrishna who offered to customize any meal for the2-year old and accommodating special takeaway requests (he in fact voluntarily asked us for our plans and made great suggestions for baby food), to the staff at Citrus Cafe who so willingly watched over the lil one and played with her, to the Front desk manager who offered us a room to freshen-up after checkout, the staff are going beyond their call of duty!
They're setting some new benchmarks for service standards here... Am actually scared that our little one will start expecting this service everywhere now :)

Special mention about their differently abled staff. Nowhere have I seen so many of them working in the same location. They are at the front desk, help with housekeeping, at the cafe.. they are everywhere and are treated as equals by the rest of the staff and the guests!!

1260,Jan 2017,Genuine warmth is touching!,"Can you expect a business hotel to cater to a family stay with kids? You can, with a neat package and a ribbon tied on it. The personal concern showed by every employee, be it at the reception, at the restaurant, spa, housekeeping or room service was exemplary and I truly haven't experienced such a fulfilling stay in any part of India, Europe or America!

Our little daughter was pampered and spoilt by all, every whim and requirement of hers were expressly taken care of and everything was customised and modified to fit our needs.

Ola cabs are always available in and around the area to wherever one needs to go even though the location in perfect for a business traveller to Hyderabad.

Especially unforgettable was when we checked out, roamed around and came back to get our luggage. We just wanted to have a coffee in the lounge cafe but since the baby was sleeping they insisted on us taking a room and ordering coffee from there. That was real warmth and was very touching.

We were thoroughly impressed that so many differently abled employees were around. They were wearing t-shirts which said ""Different and Proud of It!"". There was no difference in the genuine concern and warmth that they exuded though.

One thing which I thought was great is their policy of hiring disabled staff (I saw a couple of men who were deaf and dumb). I thought this was brilliant and those staff members were great when I interacted with them.
Food was tasty in the Kebab restaurant and also the Noodle restaurant on the mezzanine level. Breakfast selection was smaller than some hotels but fresh and totally adequate.

Parking light is not there at all.

TV remote is absolutely useless.

1318,Oct 2016,"The lobby speaks luxury , but the rooms and service says budget.","I have been traveling to Hyderabad for a number of years now, and stayed in a number of hotels around the city. Lemon Tree Premier, I would say rates as a budget hotel on the same scale as Motel 8 in the US. Although, the hotel is rather new the cheap furniture and linens are showing a lot of wear-and-tear as you can see by the photos of room 822. Because of how much traffic a hotel room usually gets, I have not seen many rooms with laminate flooring in the 10 years of traveling, usually you see tile or carpet. The reason for that is (1) laminate flooring is not meant for high traffic, high moisture areas and (2) it does not have a comfortable or homelike feel to it.

The bed sheets and towels also look like they have been in use for years, (1) because of initial low quality (2) lack of switching by housekeeping staff. The bed sheets, are stained and thinned, because off over use and over washing. To be fair when I brought this up to the staff they were very responsive and provided me with a new set of bed sheets. I have yet to receive a towel that is not hard and grey looking. Although to be fair to the staff I have not brought the towel issue to their attention, hoping that they would notice it themselves.

The hotel has three restaurants I have eaten in two of the three (1)Citrus and (2)Republic of Noodles. Breakfast is served at Citrus and that is also the hotels all day dining restaurant. I was not a huge fan of the breakfast selection at Citrus, but it was better than what I expected when it comes to a budget hotels. The lunch at Citrus, was not so good I ordered two items Lebanese Mezze , which is noted at a signature dish and Chicken Tikka In Multi Grain. I ended up sending both of the items back as Lebanese Mezze tasted sour and old, the humus was clumpy instead of smooth, baba ghanoush had a sour taste to it and the Chicken Tikka was cold and tasted like it was cooked or at least prepped a few days ago. The one bright side to the Citrus experience was the staff, the chef was very apologetic and wanted to make up for the disappointing lunch. Now, the bright side of my stay has to be eating dinner at the Republic of Noodles the food and service at the restaurant was really good. From the appetizer to the main course everything was perfectly season and fresh.",3.0,October 2016,business,Greg_aka_Flare,122,5,"New York City, New York",,3.0,2.0,,,2.0

I think there needs to be a better understanding about what happens to a westerners digestive system when it's exposed to the intense food in India, a consequence of this is that a hotel needs to have a plentiful supply of good toilet paper. Not this hotel, you get a 1/8th sized roll of the narrowest thinnest toilet paper I've ever come across, and that's it - that's actually the new roll, there are no spare rolls.

1346,Sep 2016,One the best places for corporate stays in Hitec City,"I have been a regular visitor to Hyderabad and have stayed in this Hotel during most of my visits; Sometimes, I have also stayed at a stretch for a long time (>1 year). My overall experience at the hotel has been very positive, pleasant and conformable. The staff makes a constant effort to know and satisfy customer preferences at all times - certain names bear mention here - Safdar and Azar from Front Office, Chef Rais from Citrus Cafe, Reddy from Housekeeping and Deepak from Gym. These people see to it that I continue to enjoy my stay.

While I am familiar to the most of the staff who know my preferences, I have also come across certain instances of close friends having undesirable experiences sometimes. I would like to request hotel administration to be overly cautious in caring for friends and family of regular customers who show up based on recommendation.

Rest, I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a comfortable and refreshing yet economical stay during visit to Hyderabad City.",5.0,August 2016,business,Rajwardhan D,4,1,"New Delhi, India",,4.0,,,5.0,5.0

The road shops have en number of collections, varieties, models and have purchased few items there after bargaining. The hotel food was good and it was so comfortable with my tongue as well as stomach.But, i was expected little more spicy since it was Hyderabad. Interior of the restaurant was nice and that could be too good when few paintings added i think. The lounge was kept so clean and fragrance all the time pleasantly.

Why spend your hard earned money on some 5 star hotels where paying through your pockets doesn't guarantee the best service.

But at lemon tree every thing would be taken care by their team and you are bound to be delighted.

No beer or snacks allowed by the poolside. The beer I can understand due to glass bottles but snacks? I found that a bit weird.
We were charged for double occupancy + an additional amount for an extra bed ($ 22) but wi fi was limited to one device only.
The food was good on one day and not so good on the other so it could be more consistent.

The Ugly
We were woken up every morning at 9am with loud drilling and banging above us. The hotel was gracious enough to give us a $14 discount on the bill but on a short weekend break, drilling sounds are an absolute no no.

One of the best decorated receptions gives way to very average room decor and terrible service thereafter. Waiters openly arguing in the breakfast area with one of their own against some good tip/recognition he received on a Saturday morning. Front desk and all service personnel in general have been specifically asked not to serve guests with anything resembling a smile. If you check out and come back 30 mins later asking for access to your room because you may have left your wifi dongle in there they'll flat out refuse you. Reason: the room 'MAY' have been allotted to another guest. No doctors available if you ask them to call one because you are feeling unwell. The swimming pool is over chlorinated and your eyes will keep burning four hours after you've taken a swim. And God forbid if you get a midnight call to urgently report to another city the next morning. They'll ensure to charge you for the next day and state it's in their policies. Frankly other than the fabulous location advantage there is hardly anything going with this hotel.

1406,Aug 2016,The bad and the ugly...,"One year into my continuing relationship with this Hotel property and having spent hours in painful explanations I have reached an impasse with certain aspects of this establishment. As a consequence, and with a heavy heart, I have decided to write an extremely contrasting review this time.
The subject of this outburst is the Housekeeping department at Lemon Tree. Having experienced hotel life for more than a year i have realized that what you want at the end of the day, more than anything else, is coming back to a clean and convenient environment (if not to your liking then at least giving the bare bone minimum) . Unfortunately my experience over the past few months has been really bad. From finding unhygienic utensils and dirty floors to utter disregard for linen quality, i can now say i have experienced the ugly bits to its extent.
I have stopped expecting anything which is even remotely customized for you in a way where the staff realizes your preferences, your choices and your knickknacks through past interactions. Unfortunately the hotel has no way of tracking your needs and wants and fails egregiously to even do a respectable job with the services you would expect from a good three star hotel (this being rated better than that).
I hope this post helps in aligning your expectation the next time you visit. Maybe I am frustrated and maybe there is considerable bias in my epilogue but i hope i have saved you from some loss of peace....because ""Expectation is the mother of frustration"".",3.0,August 2016,business,Sudhanshu1988,2,,"Hyderabad, India",,1.0,1.0,4.0,,

This hotel is very close to many of the MNC in Hi tech City and situated on the main road, said that you cannot expect a good view though.

The cab service is too slow and something that you cannot relay on for your commute. Most of the times the cabs are not available and if they are, they don't turn on time.

Checking into the hotel was smooth, considering my I checked in at 1:30 am and the formalities were completed in 5 mins or so. Madhu at the front desk was very helpful . I requested for a higher floor room and Madhu provided me with one.
What I loved about the hotel:
The rooms are very spacious and were clean.
The bathroom has all the necessary toiletries one expects from hotels like Lemon Tree Premier. Plus my room had a bathtub so cant complain
The breakfast and dinner spreads are decent. The Indian restaurant called the Kebab Theater has a nice décor and food is decent. Pratima at the restaurant is such a nice person to speak to.
The pool on the 11th floor is clean and nice place to relax
The main reason I would recommend to stay at the hotel is their staff. Very polite and are eager to help.
I had good conversations with most of the staff I interacted with. Thanks to Sindi,Swaraj, Pawan ,Ved Vyas and Chef Ankit for taking such good care of me.
Lemon Tree also like RedFox employs Differently abled people and is such a wonderful thing to see . Really love this initiative by the group.

What I found a bit annoying:
Lemon Tree suffers from same issue that RedFox does. The entertainment channels are limited and too slow. It takes a lot of time to switch between channels.
The USB drive on the DVD player did not recognize my USB drive, not sure if it was the player of my room though I did not bother to find out or have it fixed.
The wifi only allows you to connect to one device at a time which can be an issue if you have more than 1 device you want to connect .
These are minor inconveniences but the good rooms and amazing staff are more than compensate for this. A thumbs up for this Lemon Tree Premier .",5.0,July 2016,business,SanketRao,567,52,"Mumbai, India",,5.0,5.0,5.0,,

A magnificent lobby, nice spacious rooms, attentive staff, and great food! That is what a business hotel all about.

They have three restaurants. The main one serves an enormous breakfast buffet and dinner buffet. The breakfast spread consists of the regular egg/bacon/sausage items with lots of different breads, choices of cheese, yoghurt, salami etc, and many south indian and north indian items.

The dinner spread similarly has a vast array of items, from indian, continental and chinese/southeast asian cuisines.

The republic of noodles serves excellent southeast cuisine - they have an excellent selection of vegetable and meat items. The tofu is good. But the menu also has an excellent choice of items such as roast pork, braised beef, javanese duck curry etc. The duck curry is excellent - but if you do not like sweet flavour in your curry, you need to tell the chef to tone it down!

Overall the room was spacious and offered the standard fare of accessories, hair dryer, iron and ironing board, a modest minibar etc. The free Wi-Fi was adequate for standard usage at 1.5mbps speed download with a much higher upload which is convenient for uploading files if you are on business. For a small fee you get much faster internet with support for more devices if you are there with family and multiple tablets/phones, etc.

It offers a modest buffet with standard breakfast choices matching more towards the Asian palate. The dinner buffet (at the same location) was more interesting with some wonderful Indian dishes. The room service was fast and discreet. Apart from the main breakfast/dinner café space, there is also a very nice restaurant and a decent bar on different floors.

A renovation/refresh of the bathrooms could go a long way. One of the towels had a rust stain and it seems no softener was used since they smelled washed but not soft & fresh like home. The soap shampoo and cream selection seemed a bit stale. Not that it matters anyway, since most people bring their own.

STAFF

Hotel Staff were re so friendly that they did not let me feel alone whenever I was there at any of their restaurant, specially whenever I was at Kabab Theater (Restaurant ) and having food alone Chakma, Sarita or Pratima would give me company in spite their busy schedule .
I loved the ambience at Slounge, Shridhar thank you for curing my cold and cough with your special drink and sorry for boaring everyone with old Bollywood song I sung during karaoke night ☺😊😃, Sagar you really make an awesome cocktails & Mocktail . Lokesh you have got really good mentors around and I am sure with the kind of energy you maintain throughout the day you will learn it all and next time I visit you will make drink for me..
Chef though I forgot your name but I really thank you for customizing the food varients for me …I can understand it must be difficult for you going out of the menu and serving me the delicacies ..those were really tasty and far better than I excepted it to be..

HOUSEKEEPING

Akram you are the real Hero who keeps our room ready while we come tired from work and enter the room it always gave us a pleasant feeling looking at the things arranged in place…we hardly get time to meet you As you come while we are gone…but your Job says it all and deserves lots of applause..

AMBIANCE

As it is named Lemontree you will observe a lime fragrance in the Hotel, there is separate smokers and nonsmokers floor, each of their floor is secured with the access card ..there are enough facilities to keep yourself occupied Gym, swimming pool , Spa and indoors game etc..

FOOD

They have 3 restaurant and 1 of them remains open almost 24 hours so anytime you feel hungry go and grab the food, foods are really delicious also you can ask for customizing it if you really want as per your taste, but I would recommend have the chef version they make awesome food.

1443,Jul 2016,It’s more than a home away from your home,"When I was first informed by my office that I need to stay for one month at Hyderabad, I was very much nervous. Because moving out of your hometown with a 9 month old daughter and staying in a new city for one month is not an easy task. My office arranged my stay at Lemon Tree Premier hotel at Hyderabad. All my apprehension gone when I reached the hotel . Located at Hitec City and close to my office was an added advantage which saved my daily travel time.

Starting from first day till the last moment – my family and especially my daughter received all the possible help from all the hotel staffs. We were received by Azhar (Asst Manager) at the reception, who took the special care for our month long stay. I must appreciate and thank Mounika, Pasand, Firoz for providing guidance and arranging my local tours on weekends

Our main concern was midday meal for my 9 month old daughter when I would be at office. But special thanks to In-room Dining Incharge Lakshmi (Asst Manager) who took personal initiative to get Baby Meal prepared by the chef everyday and supplied to our room in time by Rony (assisted by Ranjan, Gautham)
Breakfast at the Citrus Café was excellent. The area is spacious and has a good ambience. It offers a lot of varieties and menu is changed meticulously everyday to give you a feeling of the beginning of the new day. I must mention the way it is presented everyday – full credit must go to the F & B Manager and the Chef . This was one of the favourite areas of my daughter. She was liked by all the staffs at the café, especially Sindi . Thanks to Venkat,Veda, Akshit, Swaraj, Rahul, Vaishali for their excellent service. Since other kids used to be in the cafe with their parents, my daughter used to have playing time with them while we enjoyed our food.

Rooms at Lemon Tree Premier are very spacious and clean. Special care was taken by House Keeping staff Amit and his team (Shanker, Naresh, Mamtha, Nagesh) in keeping the floor clean where my daughter used to crawl (She loves doing it).

In the afternoon, we used to spend time either at the side of the Swimming pool in the 11th floor . Front desk security staff Biman suggested visit to the backyard garden of he hotel and took us there personally.

One special thing about Lemon Tree Premier is that it is a recipient of Hellen Keller award and it employs a good number of differently abled persons who proudly provide good service along with their peers.

At the end of one month of our stay, when we left the hotel we distributed sweets to the hotel staffs to show our gratitude for their good service (it’s a Bengali tradition). My daughter received gifts from the hotel staffs. Even after one week of our return to Kolkata, I still feel that my daughter misses the good ambience of Citrus Café at breakfast and at dinner time.

I recommend this hotel to everyone. Whenever I will visit Hyderabad again, I will definitely be back at Lemon Tree Premier.",5.0,June 2016,business,Koyel D,8,3,,,5.0,,,5.0,5.0

1482,Jun 2016,"Excellent, except for the front desk","I would have given 5 stars to this hotel, for the overall experience, except for our experience with their Front Desk. So, my membership with their hotels entitles me to a free upgrade to a suite, based on availability at check in. When we checked in, we were told that all suites were booked for that night, but we could move into a suite for the following nights of our stay, which was perfect, especially since we were traveling with a little baby. The next day, when we asked the front desk for the new room number, the surprising response was ""no suites available... who told you you would get it... because I'm going to call and check..."" - essentially the next half hour was spent verifying 'my claim' and gave a really bad feeling. Of course, soon after they did move us to a suite but couldn't really answer my question as to how in 30 mins the status changed from ""no suites available"" to ""here are your keys"".

Other than that, an absolutely wonderful stay... special appreciation for the hotel's support in hiring people who cannot hear or speak but provide such wonderful and warm service!

On the suite experience - just fantastic. Very well designed, with an excellent layout giving a great sense of space. We were able to fit the babycot also in the bedroom (hotel provided) without any issues. TVs in the bedroom & living room were big at least 42""). Though we were on the 2nd floor and facing the main intersection, there was no traffic noise for the most part. The bathroom didn't come with a tub though, which I would have expected. All the other usual amenities were provided, including 2 bottles of drinking water each day, weighing scale in the bathroom and a yoga mat too!

Two points of feedback in case the hotel folks are actually reading this - (1) it would be good to have a curtain or some partition between the living room & bedroom, with the choice of closing it. (2) You could provide at least 2 hand towels by default, especially when its double occupancy.

Quick note on room service - we ordered a biriyani which most likely came from their Kebab Theater kitchen.. bad idea! I think its best to always go for their sandwiches / burgers or Asian food (from Republic of Noodles).",4.0,May 2016,family,kan_rach,385,28,"Mumbai, India",,5.0,,5.0,,5.0

We stayed in the property for 10 days and needless to say, each and every single day was amazing. The staff here will make sure that you have everything and are ever-smiling. Their job is hard and they meet hundreds and thousands of people every single day, but they will make an extra effort to remember you and cater to you.

In Citrus Cafe where we had our food, we met Sarita (She is a manager) and is one of the happiest souls I have come across. Wonderful, amiable and always chatty, she makes your dining/lunching experience wonderful.

Another person, Pawan who often served us and we met him at Republic of Noodles too (The Pan-Asian restaurant) at Lemon Tree, was also very warm. He was extra courteous and it is always wonderful to be served by him.

Chef Ankit at Citrus Cafe was also very nice. He made sure we liked our food and one day even made us Chicken Stew on demand. It was not in the menu and I was craving it, so he promptly went and made it. That was a very wonderful gesture.

The rooms are spacious and you can order different pillows if you are not comfortable with the one you have. They have a pillow menu! We were not comfortable with the mattress provided because it was tooooo soft and so we got it changed to a harder version and this request was catered in less than ten minutes!

The rooms are always impeccably clean and the gym is very well equipped. The swimming pool is located in a very quiet rooftop area and is great to swim there because there are hardly any people!

The only qualm I have is the hand wash provided. It's called 'Sea Salt Hand Wash' and unfortunately smells really weird! I wish you could change it!",5.0,April 2016,couple,Angana Gohain B,3,2,"New Delhi, India",5.0,5.0,,,5.0,

My luggage (three huge boxes) came all nicely wrapped with plastic and they had baggage tags on them. After my boxes went through the X-Ray machine, the staff took it upon themselves to tear off the baggage tags. This pulled off the plastic shrink wrapping from the boxes and I had to have it re-packed at the airport later on, at my own cost, which was really frustrating.

I had to check-out, and I called the reception and asked them to send the bell-boy with the baggage trolley so I can put my boxes. There were three massive boxes, and they were all very heavy. 15-mins later, no one showed up. I called again, and 15-mins passed by and no one showed up. Eventually I started to move the bags on my own. When I was almost done moving the bags, someone came to my room, just to inspect if I had consumed anything from the mini-bar, and when I asked them to help with the luggage, he refused to. This was really frustrating.

During check-out, the counter staff was finishing up my check-out and mid-way he started helping someone else and I had to wait for a few more minutes before finally checking out.

1557,Feb 2016,Great hotel for corporate long stay,"This is my second review about Lemon Tree Premier, Hitech City, Hyderabad where I have been staying for business for a long time.

The hotel has an ideal location for business in Hitech City. The rooms are spacious and clean. However, the house keeping staff is not observant of a customer’s needs. Supplies are not replenished often enough to the customer’s liking.

Most of the hotel staff is very friendly and always wear a smile. However, there are some who would not even bother greeting you. This works to an extent that you might be purposefully missed while sitting with someone who is wished and served.

The food in the award winning Republic of Noodles restaurant is something to always look forward to. The food is consistently good and Chef Vikram makes the dining experience a delight.

Consistent efforts are made to take special care of long staying guests. Credit goes to Mr. Arun Gupta for making the stay comfortable.",4.0,February 2016,business,KiratD29,3,3,"New Delhi, India",,,,,,

Originally, This was the best experience till date I had with my family and all credit goes to Lemontree hotel staff which was so cordial and welcoming to literally every request we had. During the weekends we planned trips to nearby places like Srisailam, New cap city Amaravathi we got clear travel information from help desk. and the hotel was perfectly fine with our early check-in, which was a boon as compared to other hotels in the city like Avasa and Radison that simply won't allow that unless you pay the price!
During the stay our baby got 6-months old and that is when babies start solid food. We had no clue about that but a lady (Lakmi) and chef sarah provided all the tips/guidance and sent some specially made in their kitchen baby food to our room, which our daughter really cherished. Now at home we really miss that.
One of my relative did not have the reservation and the hotel was sold out, still they were able to accommodate them in their sister property, showing the extent to which the hotel will go to make sure we have a comfortable stay.

1585,Jan 2016,Very spacious and inviting,"Been there with family for a few days earlier this month, and it's been a pleasant experience. The double bed room is very spacious and we hardly felt the noisy traffic outside. You have facilities like a mini fridge, mini vault and an alarm in the room. The restaurant(Citrus) on the ground floor serve a good variety and worked out well for our vegetarian family. The servers there especially are very courteous and prompt.The tea lounge(supposedly serves varities of tea & coffee world over) is a relaxing place to have your tea or coffee and snacks. As we were there for few days only, didn't get the option to use their sauna, pool room or gym. The wi-fi provided by hotel(no charge) is very reliable, and is payable only if you prefer higher speeds. What I especially like about this hotel is how spacious it is and a very inviting decor - good paintings, lots of cool quotes are hung on walls everywhere, many of them on mini t-shirts and also on the restaurant tables.

Cons -
- The vault and alarm in room were not functional
- You need to request bucket & mug as they are not available by default, even so, we never got ours after we spoke to a housekeeping staff
- Network can be an issue depending on which room you are in! Luckily, we could get decent signal most of the time.
- Delay of few hours by housekeeping staff to pickup leftover lunch from room but mostly they have been prompt.
- The experience at Tea Lounge downstairs have been mixed, the first day was horrible as they got our order wrong(the coffee was average) and also served 45mins late. The next day, the experience was much better, the snacks & coffee/tea were delicious but the wait was once again excruciating(nearly an hour).

Location -
It is approximately 30mins or lesser from the Rajiv Gandhi Intl airport in the morning hours, in the evening traffic can be a pain and the drive could take more than an hour. Nearly 10-15mins from the international convention centre, and 15mins or so to affordable shopping places like Koti. If you plan to go shopping, avoid evening hours due to the insane traffic.",4.0,January 2016,family,Manjo D,4,,,,4.0,,,5.0,4.0

1587,Jan 2016,Miserable hotel,"As another reviewer said - I couldn't wait to leave. I stayed here for 2 nights and due to a scarcity of rooms in Hyderabad because of a conference, I paid double the usual rate. To add insult to injury, the hotel is very poor and not even close to 'luxury'. I've stayed in countless hotels when in India for work or travel and LemonTee Premier is almost ranks as low as the dreadful Centaur in Delhi (courtesy an Air India flight delay).

My room (on the 10th floor) was dorm-like, smelled really terrible (damp? sewage?), the shower was barely lukewarm, the towels were thin and greying, and the aircon was not adjustable so it was a choice of either dress warmly or turn it off. Given the location, there was endless traffic noise and I needed ear plugs to sleep. The sheets were clean and the bed was ok. Room service food was horrible (and on one night not what I ordered). Breakfast was ok and the lunch buffet at Citrus (part of the conference) is good.

I was delivering a conference in the hotel for 3 days (for a client of mine, a large local company and a regular customer at Lemontree). Given this, and the exorbitant rate I paid, I was very surprised that there was zero flexibility re a late check out for my evening flight. I was told twice that I would have to pay a full night extra (at the hiked rate) which, of course, I refused.

The whole place is soul-less. A few staff are excellent - but most appear to be uncaring, clue-less and unsmiling. There is no 'warmth'. Staff need to be trained to be helpful and welcoming - and if they don't know or understand something, to ask a manager for assistance rather than look blank, do nothing or say they'll do something then disappear. But then, I didn't see any managers around so maybe there aren't any.

Everything about the hotel from rooms, ambience,food,staff and customer service is superb. Managers and hotel staff ensure that they help their customers in the best possible way, that helped us to plan great surprise for one of our colleagues birthday. The hotel has facilities like gym,pool, spa and lounge where we can enjoy and relax. Also the hotel has best of the restaurants like Kebab Theatre and Noodles of China serving amazing cuisines. The most outstanding feature of the hotel is that, some of their staff members addressing the customers are deaf and dumb who enthusiastically do their day to day chores to serve the customers. Thus, in its own way Lemontree is supporting a noble cause.",5.0,December 2015,business,tejal m,1,,,,,,,,
1593,Jan 2016,Overall Good hotel,I stayed there for one night with family and had terrible check-in experience. The front office staff declined me a room though I had pre-paid booking with confirmation. Reached there after 6 hour car drive and most horrible experience. It got sorted after I pulled some strings. Rest of the experience was good. Most of other staff was very warm and supportive. Rooms were neat and clean with most modern amenities. House keeping staff is wonderful. Breakfast @ citrus cafe can improve. Location is very good in terms of proximity to offices and restaurants.

I would say this hotel is best suited when one is visiting for business purposes and doesn't have to stay for long duration. In terms of amenities the hotel is decently equiped - with an average gym and a swimming pool.
Best part: I really love the concept of employing deaf and dumb people by the hotel. These people who deserve equal respect from the society are rightfully employed. Kudos.
Bad part: I have found the people at the front desk (may be the management) unaccommodating and at times unresponsive as well. Most big hotels would extend small concessions to regular visitors. This hotel has none of that. Then there was a time when I wanted to complain about something at the reception desk. Guess what: they didn't have a register to raise my complaint.

Food: Breakfast has decent options and generally comes complementary. So thumbs up!!",3.0,December 2015,business,irc11,15,7,"Bengaluru, India",,3.0,,3.0,,3.0
1595,Jan 2016,Best Premier Hotel In Hitec city of Cyberabad,"The buzzing hotel amidst the fortune global corporations in downtown of pearl city. The 24 hours coffee shop named Citrus cafe though is on high side for buffet for the spread given, you can always pick your favorite stuff on ala carte. The Kabab theatre themed bollywood style, and you can taste some good kababs and biryani. The best part about Kabab Theatre is that they serve delicious Pani puri, before serving our order. And my favorite in Lemon tree is the Republic of Noodles restaurant. Its one of the the best restaurant in town, which serves authentic Asian cuisine.

The gym is cool, and the cool SPA is owned by Tattva. Rooms are tidy and cool, and the best part is the hospitality and service. Hotel staff are very friendly, and their service and hospitality stands as an another reason for you to drop in again and again.

The swimming pool on the 11th floor is open to sky, and is the best place to get that badly needed solitude and seclusion in the middle of concrete jungle, when you return back from tiresome work.

The service was immaculate and staff were amiable and once you enter the restaurant you will get to meet two CHARISMATIC Personalities Mr Vivek Vikram Singh and Sandeep Singh and they did not only took good care of me but my entire family throughout my stay and made me feel as if i am staying with TAJ or OBEROI hotels. This personalised service was very touching for me and atleast they both made sure from now onwards i cannot even think of staying in anyother hotels atleast in INDIA.

The view from the room was excellent and the HAPPY hours made our visit complete with the value for money.

CLEANLINESS AND HYGIENE were the key and it seemed as if the hotel made special efforts to maintain clean and the greenery outside gave the hotel an eco friendly appearance.

AFTER a sumptuos BREAKFAST when we left the hotel it was with a feeling of a wonderful stay and regretted if only we could have extended it .
Thankyou guys!!!Would love to visit million more times !!! Cheers.",5.0,November 2015,business,99Harpreet,1,,"Hyderabad, India",5.0,5.0,,,,4.0

1647,Nov 2015,Not a 4 Star Property,"Although name carries Premier but its not at all a Premier hotel. Its just an ordinary hotel, probably a budget hotel. Budget hotel in terms of facilities it offers and not in term of room charges. Room sizes are normal. Interiors are as typical lemon tree style. But there is nothing to cheer about in this property. I had bitter experiences during my 3 night stay.
First when I reached hotel premises, there was no one for security check for my baggage.
Secondly paid internet @475 is only for one device and speed is just average (less than 400 KB download speed). Hotel claims it to be cheapest rate plan, but it is not the case.
Thirdly room service was just ordinary. Had to call 3 times service desk for sending a water bottle and a ice bucket to my room. It was delivered in 30 mins.
Complimentary toiletries provided in the room are refill. Not expected at all from a premier property.
Breakfast buffet spread is good and gives lot many options. But refill of the items is very slow.

Despite all these odds, there are few people in staff which are really awesome. Laxmi in CitrusCafe is one. She knows what hospitality is and how to make for lapses.

I had communicated all my issues to the Hotel Manager and I believe some positive action will be taken up by the management.",3.0,October 2015,business,Amit G,118,112,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",,2.0,4.0,,,1.0

All of the staff from reception (speccially Monika), Citrus restaurant (Lakshimi and other staff), the chefs (Ankit, JP & Hashmi) were all very nice and friendly. Chef Ankit even arranged for me to be given a tour of the kitchen and was showed how indian breads and dishes are prepared. If the hotel offered cooking lessons, I would be one of the first to enrol for it!

The buffet for breakfast and dinner were outstanding, there was a great variety of choice for everyone. And if there is something missing despite the huge choice, you can still ask the staff to prepare it especially for you.

I would definitely recommend this hotel and would not hesitate in staying again. The location is ideal for any visitor to Hyderabad Hitech district.

1665,Oct 2015,Very Good Hotel for Business Travel,"I have been traveling frequently to Hyderabad for over one year now. I always stay at Lemon Tree Premier because I have never felt the need to change my hotel.

PROS:
1) Very good location and close to all major office buildings in HITEC City
2) Very friendly and helpful staff
3) Clean rooms with all the required amenities
4) Well equipped gym and a permanent gym instructor
5) Outdoor swimming pool
6) Kebab Theater and Republic of Noodles are very good restaurants specializing in Indian and Asian cuisines respectively.
7) The staff and manager (Mr. Arun Gupta) are always receptive towards special needs of the customers.
8) Spa services for relaxation also available in the hotel
9) Breakfast buffet has a good spread of items and 24 hours in-room dining.
10) Free wifi available

CONS:
1) Though there is free wifi available, it is for one device only. Wifi for the second device needs to be purchased. Also, the speed provided by free wifi is not satisfactory.
2) The quality of food at Citrus Cafe can be improved. More often than not, the food is very oily. There have been a few instances where even specific instructions with regards to food quality have not been followed. However, the food quality has improved lately but there is still scope for improvement.

OVERALL:
I would strongly recommend this hotel for all kinds of travelers, especially those traveling for business purposes.

The alternate hotel was 8 kms from the one where I had a reservation and much farther from my office, causing a great deal of inconvenience.

The hotel has an ideal location for business in HITEC City. The rooms are spacious and clean. The hotel houses amenities for leisure like swimming pool, spa and gym.

The hotel has an excellent diversity in the staff. Many mute people are employed by this hotel, which is note-worthy. The staff is very friendly and always wear a smile.

1677,Oct 2015,Something to do with Nizam...!,"I work for a consulting firm and have been regularly travelling to Hyderabad on a project for the past 3-4 months. Lemon Tree has been the hotel of choice for me during these frequent visits. While i still search for a funny yet apt tittle for my review let me give you a detailed description to you of my stay here...

Rooms: Although i am not entirely sure but there at least three to four different type of rooms under the same category. The rooms are north/south facing with views to some of the upcoming IT firms in Hitec city. i have stayed on almost every floor and room type and have arrived at the conclusion that rooms between X01-X08 (total 25/floor approx.) are the best in terms of view location and interior arrangements (the 08 series having two rooms is the best in the lot). The rooms are well designed and are comfortable for a single person occupancy.

Service:
1. Food - It houses one of the best Chinese restaurants in Hyderabad - Republic of Noodles. There is one more specialty restaurant called 'Kebab Theater' with good quality Indian food and as my colleagues tell me some of the best kebabs they have had ( I am a vegetarian). In room dining services are decent but the turn around time has scope for improvement. The cafe hosts buffet for lunch and dinner, I recommend you to visit it once for the friendly and caring staff.

2. Housekeeping: The services are pretty much standard. Additional emphasis is paid by the hotel to keep things environment friendly. The hotel has taken some very good initiatives under this segment including employing differently abled people.

3. Gymnasium: If I had to point to one thing which has kept me anchored to this place on every trip this would be it. The equipment is high quality, its spacious, clean and well maintained.I have had one of my best workout experiences with the gym instructor here. Deepak not only helps with the essentials but has also gone out of his way to help accommodate people requiring special attention. I have enjoyed discussing the many details and aspects of fitness, it has been a enriching experience.

4. Internet Wi-Fi - The wi-fi at the hotel is average. You might want to keep your photon handy (just in case scenario).

Accessibility: Its optimally located inside Hitec city. Offices are located within 15-20 mins drive. There is a fairly decent mall located in the vicinity.

Overall: Over a period of three months my experience has been consistently good. I would recommend this hotel for future stays in Hyderabad.",4.0,June 2015,business,Sudhanshu1988,2,,"Hyderabad, India",,4.0,,4.0,,3.0

1680,Oct 2015,I had the pleasure of staying here 13 nights for a business trip.,"The people in the restaurant is great! I just have to thank Ankit, Sandeep, Vivek, Ali and Vishnu for making my meals enjoyable during my stay!
Clean and spacious room.
I just had some issues with the internet connection during my last night. Basically, the IT staff mentioned that they changed plans and that's what caused my issue. I didn't actually have any problems with it had they notified me but I wasn't informed. Also, the IT staff was not the most eager to pacify my concern. I think he should learn a thing or 2 about customer service from the restaurant staff. :)

Overall, my stay was great! I'd recommend this to anyone who would visit the area!

1681,Oct 2015,“A sanctuary”,"we loved our stay at The Lemon Tree premier earlier this month.

To start with the staff are divine and make you feel special and so welcome. From the security staff at the entrance, to the bell boys, to the concierge, to housekeeping and the turn down service, everyone was so friendly and respectful.
Hyderabad is pretty chaotic, especially for us visiting from a competitively empty island, and the hotel was a cool, peaceful haven.

Our room was beautiful. It was large and comfortable and had a nice view.
Breakfast was excellent. We were spoiled for choice and the egg chefs did miracles with my daily omelette.Service is just mind blowing .Best part they remember the guest preference.And will serve you the same once you will reach the Cafe.

Hope that one day we'll be able to return. There's something very other-worldly about The Lemon Tree premier that I haven't experienced anywhere else.
Don't miss the pool. It's very special and every time I visited was mostly deserted.

1685,Sep 2015,One of the best places to stay while on a business trip,"Lemon Tree Premier in Hitec City, Hyderabad is one of the best places to stay while on a business trip. This is my second review for the same property, the first one was almost 2 years back, and that one was a not-so-good one. Many things have changed for better since then.

The hotel rooms are squeaky clean and linen is changed regularly. The hotel has a very refreshing ambiance in the lobby and corridors. The hotel houses one the best Asian cuisine restaurants in the city - Republic Of Noodles. The Indian cuisine restaurant - The Kebab Theater, is not far behind and serves scrumptious traditional mogul delicacies - the Murg Tangadi Kebad and Dal Makhani are a must try. The strength of the hotel lies in the staff. The staff his very warm and will go out of their ways to satisfy individual customer preferences. Mr. Narotam Singh and Mr Arun Gupta merit a special mention for their personal attention to customer requirements and assurance of satisfaction those requirements. These two people and their entire staff - including the specially abled members of the staff who always wear smile in their faces - never tire of giving a satisfactory customer service.

Good things apart, the Citrus café still does not live up to the standard. The café still has a lot of room for improvement in terms of management. The customer orders are mixed as servers do not make note of orders and many a times order takes inordinately long. However, Café kitchen is manned a skilled chefs Mr Durga and Jaiprakash.

I have been staying here for a long time and the stay has been satisfactory. I would strongly recommend the my fellow business travelers to consider this an option before making their hotel reservation.",4.0,August 2015,business,Rajwardhan D,4,1,"New Delhi, India",5.0,4.0,4.0,,,

1691,Sep 2015,"Good place to stay, very good staff, near to most of the tech companies","I had being to Hyderabad on a company visit and decided to stay at Lemon Tree. First of all thanks to the staff for adjusting my checkin timings as I was early. I love their ambience and the way put things in places. Though Lemon Tree Bangalore is bit different then this Lemon Tree in terms of interior, as this one is much bigger in size if I am not wrong :).

This place is very near to cyber pearl tower and other companies in and around. You can walk around to Cyber tech building if you wish to but make sure you walk from the other side which has footpath as this would be safe.

What I love about Lemon Tree is their one liners, thoughts and jokes placed around the hotel. I make sure to read them every time I visit. Some of them I have attached in photos.

Room which I was staying was spacious for me as I was traveling alone and its a perfect place to stay. I meet lot of people when I visit their Slounge, chat with them, know them, a perfect place for knowing people around the world coming to these tech cities. I love to play pool while having few beers. For smokers, this Lemon Tree Slounge has a smoking room within the Slounge itself while in Bangalore you have to walk out of the hotel to smoke.

Breakfast Buffet is widely spread and you have lot of choice for your early morning breakfast. Have not tried food other then breakfast over here as was out most of time, but will try for sure on my next visit.

Yes, best part of my stay was LT promoting disabled people to work with them and it feels good when you try to communicate with them.

1757,Jul 2015,Best Treatment At Right Cost & Location,"I am in Hyderabad for a month and still have couple of weeks more to stay here.

The courtesy and care that has been extended to me by the hotel staff so far has been so delightful that not writing a review would have been like committing a crime :-)

Starting with the location of the hotel, it is perfect, as the hotel is located in the center of the heart of ""happening"" Hyderabad that is the Hitec City.

The interiors of the hotel are very plush and contemporary and the rooms are very cozy at the same time very well maintained and all the housekeeping staff is very courteous and prompt. Even then if you feel some shortcomings in the service, it will be promptly addressed once you call the housekeeping.

One thing that you'll quickly notice is that 15% of the staff, as I was informed, consist of hearing & speech impaired people. This is very thoughtful and kudos to the management for being a equal opportunity employer, we need more such Indian companies in our country.

The high point of the stay for me is the visit to the Citrus cafe every day where the buffet breakfast and other meals are served. The pampering that I have received is beyond words.

What kind of food would I get was of a major concern for me while coming to Hyderabad as my stay was for a month and I was to work in shifts due to my project reuirements, but once I mentioned my situation to Vivek & Vishal, the floor managers, they introduced me to chef JP Verma & management trainee Ankit and since then I did not had to worry about my food. Other then regular buffet servings any dish I requested was made available for me. Anyways the buffet is quiet elaborate and food is good.

I find JP and Ankit to be regularly interacting with guests taking their feedbacks, making them comfortable and provide prompt service.

Service in terms of in-room dining,front desk, help required are offered with a plain face. In fact if you say that I am sleeping please keep the drilling work later, they say we're working on it and let the work continue.
If you order the food after 11pm, many things would be missing from menu and chances are you may receive food, cold. Front desk wont even care to explain you about your plan. They are so full that the entire staff is busy doing office work, in terms of service they score a big zero.

When we reached the hotel, the hotel staff was unaware of this much booking and they firstly asked us to come after 12pm!!. Later on after showing them the mails from lemon tree they gave only one room for 5-6 people. The staff behavior was also not good and they were getting irritated and not politely answering our concerns. I found the redfox service more comfortable compared to Lemon tree. There is not much difference in room between both the hotels and redfox is bit cheaper then Lemon Tree.

1785,Jun 2015,Great food and very friendly staff,"Stayed here for 8 days in June 2015 and had the most memorable stay of my life. I had the opportunity to attend the 'Lemon Tree Premier Idol' where the employees participated in various competitions and it was really good to see that the hotel cares for their staff so much. The best thing about the hotel is that 10% of their staff comprises of differently –abled employees. I have been involved with Deaf community for 6 years now and I have barely seen any employers make effort to learn Sign Language to communicate with their Deaf staff, but here at Lemon Tree hotels, I was told that each staff has to go through a basic training in Indian Sign Language so that they can reduce the communication gap and they also take help from interpreters for extra communication needs. They have things like ‘Silent Saturday’ where the whole staff and the guests have to be silent and only order by writing or signing. These efforts are truly commendable.

Apart from the warm and welcoming staff, food is also very good. They provide very healthy and wholesome breakfast and the meals are equally delicious. The hotel is very clean and the whole hotel smells of lemon grass which is very refreshing.
We visited the award-winning restaurant of the hotel the Republic of Noodles for dinner and we loved the Pan-Asian concept and the dishes served there.

For the hospitality - I will give 5 Stars... One of the best Hotels I've ever visited, the staff are very courteous, they would do everything to make you feel at home, no matter at what time you call them for help/service, they would readily be standing there for you in front of your door with a smile to assist you,

I had to invite my friends from my Business circle for a Party, I thought it would be best if we all can sit down at my room and have a kitty party at Room itself instead of going out to a Loud restaurant , the level of professionalism and hospitality shown to us was best in class, my Business friends were so over whelmed by the care given to us all thru the stay was commendable. at last when the party ended it was 1 AM in the morning, We had a smart little guy (Suman Kamila) to help us right infront of us with a broad smile even at middle of the night, I myself felt so sorry for Suman Kamila but he didn't show even a little bit of hesitation in late hours to help me and that too with an Intact SMILE. The way he showcased his Professionalism was something for me to learn for this Gentle man as to how to handle customers even at "" the not so hospitable circumstances "" , alas I would like to replicate the lessons learnt from him in my professional life too, thank you champ...

Beulah was an another impressive personality who helped me thru all my needs at Lemon tree, however small or big my requests for help, she would always have a gentle and soft voice to get me help readily available at all the times, even in early hours if in need assistance, I just knew to dial 0 from their I knew the help would arrive in moments.

The front desk has been most accommodating my requests--from mailing postcards back home to calling my room when my cab arrives.
The coffee and tea shop in the lobby is a welcome respite on the weekend where I can sit and enjoy a cup of coffee and cookies while I read a book or draw and write letters home.
The two restaurants are top notch and I've eaten dinner at these for most of my stay.
The exercise room is better than any I've had in the states which is good because I think I eat way too much at dinner. And if you need, the spa services have some great masseuses on staff. I've already booked three massages since I've been here.

Even though the prior communication wasnt good - they were personal enough to respond positively to mobile and email communiques. The breakfast choice was lovely with good live counters for egg choices, dosa pancakes etc! However in that mad rush I must emphasise the warm hospitality all throughout - the staff were uniformly proud to please you!! Also had amazing specialty restaurants worth separate reviews - nit sure if these are outsourced but continues the old world warm hospitality in a spankingly modern setup - especially the republic of noodles!

The decor and ambiance is very soothing

Food is one of the best thing i loved in the hotel.They offer a great breakfast, lunch & Dinner as well. But it's disappointing that there are less selection of desserts(Will be OK for a normal person, but i'm specific about desserts). This can be improved. I got special prawns curry on request (Andhra Style), OMG I just love it. With lot of dishes available you cannot resist yourself with limited food. (I'm a foodie)

1923,Dec 2014,Got what I expected. A good place to stay,"Stayed for four days. Courteous service. Tried the buffet (breakfast and dinner). Breakfast - very good, plenty of options, no complaints.
The dinner spread was good too, but one did get the feeling the live counter was under utilised (doing only parathas, and what they served was not a great one either).

Considering the elaborate live counter set up i was expecting pasta etc.

The rooms are spacious and well laid out. The linen/towels are fresh and clean.

The gym is well equipped and clean. Only saw the pool (on the terrace, looked clean) hope to try is next time.

Plenty of TV channels for those returning early from work.

1924,Dec 2014,Benchmark for the Best - self confessed fan!,"These guys are the best. No questions about it. I've stayed here maybe 15 times and they've never failed to amaze me. So what's special? Here's a story.

I had left my charger at the office and had some urgent long distance calls to make on a rapidly depleting cell phone charge. So i called the house keeping and asked them if they could help. They said, they'd call back. Five minutes later I had a housekeeping boy show up with: ""Sir, here's my personal charger. You can use it. I'll pick it up tomorrow as my shift is over now."" I was so surprised by the obvious ""going the second mile"" service, that I forgot to even ask him his name. I could kick myself...
I don't know the magic, but there staff is plain 'other-centered'. I asked one of the staff at the restaurant what she liked about the hotel and she said, 'the leadership treats us right'. Small wonder you can see it in their work, reflected right back to their clients in turn.
Then there's great food: Their Republic of Noodles is the finest Asian cuisine going and their morning buffet is splendid.

I know I sound like a groupie, but I've stayed at Chennai, Pune, Delhi - and its the same great service every where. (except the smaller Gurgaon property which was just okay - but that was five years back...)

What didn't work: this is a complaint against all hotels and that's the gym. The equipment and ambience is fine, but the gym instructor is the strong, silent type and doesn't connect with clients.

But overall these guys are the best, Don't waste your time with other hotels if you're going to Hitech city at Hyderabad.

Say hello to Lakshmi at Room Service, Beulah and Jenny at the front desk, Sarita at the Citrus restaurant. All good folks.",5.0,December 2014,business,Bert C,7,1,Mumbai,,5.0,5.0,,,5.0
1925,Dec 2014,Fabulous hotel for everyday living,"I've been staying in Lemon Tree premier for more than two months for business purpose. I have to say that this hotel impressed me very much and I was so surprised when I knew that it has only four stars. I've been in different counties and I'm aware about average level of service of four star hotels. Honestly, Lemon Tree is the best of four star hotel I've ever seen.

1. Location

It's located in the one of the biggest IT parks of Hyderabad – Hitech City, it is the host district for offices of major international IT companies. The way to office takes about 5-10 minutes walking by foot. There is Shilparamam market nearby the hotel, it's a nice place to buy Indian handicraft goods.

2. Scenery

I could see the awesome Hyderabad scenery from the window. Parks, offices, roads are observed very nice from the hotel's window (I lived at 6th floor). Probably, it is the highest and bigges hotel in the district.

3. Room

My room was pretty good. There were a wide bed, TV set, phone, fridge, fan, air conditioner, sofa, table and chair, fafe for valuables. It was very comfortable to work from hotel when it was needed. Wi-Fi connection had a good strength and it covered the whole hotel including elevators. There were no any delays with internet connection. Shower room was very safe to use, there was no way to splash water on the hotel floor. Lemon here is not only part of hotel name, it's a brand: hotel soap is full of lemon juice (also it is transparent and has a lemon smell), moreover, air fresheners in the hotel are based on lemon flavor as well.

4. Amenities

This hotel is full of amenities: there are gym, marvelous swimming pool at the roof of building. The swimming pool is really nice, it is equipped with day beds and towels, there are palm trees around the swimming pool and it has awesome lighting. Unfortunately, there are no heaters, so water temperature depends on weather. Gym is also very nice, it has four running tracks, a lot of “Life Fitness” machines. An instructor is also available.

Hotel has his own transportation system, so I hadn't any problems with my transportation to the airport.

5. Food service

It is awesome! The hotel (“Citrus Cafe») provides the full pack of traditional Indian meals including biryani, tea masala, Indian bread and so on. Most of them are quite spicy, but western dishes are also available. There is lot of dishes from chicken and fish, unlimited amounts of fruits like water melons, bananas, peaches, pineapples and so on. Ice cream, omelet and Indian bread are available on demand.

Apart from “Citrus Cafe» hotel has two top-level restaurants “Republic of Noodles” and “Kebab House”.

Regular room rate includes breakfast and dinner per day (or breakfast and lunch).

6. Service

Employees of Lemon Tree hotel are very polite and welcome. I've never experienced any abuse from them. Moreover, they suggested additional services for free and they were glad to have a conversation with me. I would like to say special “Thank you” to waitress Pooja because she provided a free dinner for my friend in “Citrus Cafe”. Also I would like to say “Thank you” to room cleaner Surinder Gaumder, he was cleaning my room very carefully and he was very welcome with me.

7. Bonuses.

The hotel has his own rewarding program, so I earned points for free nights in Lemon Tree hotel network. Also hotel provided a free city tour for me – driver was riding me from one place of interest to other one for a whole day.

So, if you are planning a business trip to Hyderabad Hitech City, I strongly recommend you to stay at Lemon Tree Premier!",5.0,December 2014,business,RomanM1986,5,,"Samara, Russia",,5.0,5.0,,,5.0

I would say it is one of the best hotels in terms of it's location (only if you are on an official trip) as it is right in center of the Hitech city. There are many companies within walking distance.

They've got a polite and friendly staff which are always willing to go that extra mile to help their guests.

On the facilities front, they've got 3 restaurants (1 chinese, 1 indian & a Lounge restro-bar), in addition to their Citrus cafe where breakfast/dinner buffett is served (BTW, their buffett has got lot of variety!!).

In addition, use of Gym & Pool is complimentary!! and not to forget their excellent 24hrs WiFi!!

I liked the place and staff is very friendly and helpful.
I'm absolutely satisfied by room cleaning service provided on the 5th floor by Akram.
There is swimming pool, spa and gym in the hotel. Everything is in good condition and serves for your relaxation. The gym keeper Deepak Chetry is very helpful and every time is ready to assist you on your workload.
The special thanks I'd say to the Citrus staff. The food is fresh and delicious, service is good.
Complimentary city-tour provided for long staying gives you remarkable experience on the city if you don't mind to resist you drivers intentions to bring you to his friends' souvenir or pearl shop :-)
My staying was suddenly prolonged from 6 to 8 weeks. Booking services reported there is no available room in Lemon Tree, but Mrs. Bebika at Front Desk resolved it so I was not forced to move somewhere else.

I would give 5 (Excellent) but...
Everything is fine about the hotel while you don't need to pay your bill. First of all they can spend an hour for a single bill preparation. It's ridiculous but they kept trying to get money by a small fraud. They included Internet payments even it's a part of your room charge plan, some times they included in-room snacks even if I never touched one. And finally, they raised room charge without any notification. I refused to accept such a bill and they provided me update with incorrect total sum calculation! I wrote e-mail asking to provide me correct bill on Monday. Bhaskar Mandal, the Assistant Manager Front Office is still working on it for the third day.

I would like to call out a few staffs given my multiple stays at this property – Bebika, Jenne, Bhaskar, Krishnan front desk, Chakma, Debendu, Gautam from the lounge and party organizers, Akram from house keeping and Lakshmi from In room dining desk….all of them are awesome and provide a personal touch to every stay. Front desk team in specific is very serious about their job and well groomed.

I also want to call out their Sr. Chef and I forgot his name..He is personally at the desk talking to guests and taking feedbacks during non-prime time at Kitchen. He volunteered to help me a phone once during my check out time, when I was helpless to call my driver with some issue on my mobile device. I did not even ask and this is over and above his multi cuisine talent!

1938,Dec 2014,Highly Recommended,"I have been in Hyderabad for business since August 2014 and am staying at Lemon Tree Premier Hotel in HITEC City since then. The comfort and amenities provided for the cost they charge is completely worthwhile. I have had a wonderful experience at the hotel so far and would highly recommend this hotel for either business or leisure.

Pros:
1) Ideal location for business in HITEC City.
2) Rooms are spacious, clean and well maintained.
3) Amenities like swimming pool, spa, gym and pool table are available for relaxation and leisure.
4) Food is available for 24 hrs.
5) Excellent diversity in the staff. This hotel employees many mute people which is a wonderful gesture.
6) Very friendly staff who make sure that your requests are fulfilled. Almost all the staff members I have interacted with are very helpful (to name just a few - Azhar and Bebika at the front desk, Dushant, Sarita and chef Haider in the cafe/resteraunt, and finally Arun who is a manager working tirelessly to ensure you have a wonderful stay).

Cons:
1) Sometimes, the service at their cafe becomes careless. Orders are misunderstood and service becomes slow. I guess there are bound to be some off-days given that I have been staying here for almost 4 months now.
2) On the first day, my email id was entered incorrectly during registration. Till date, I do not receive any emails from Lemon Tree regarding my membership or any other details. Despite my repeated efforts, this issue has not been solved. Though this is not a serious issue, it is a bit disappointing as I expect such issues to be resolved instantly.

1949,Nov 2014,My Journey with Lemon tree Family,"I have been travelling on offical trips very frequently from Chennai to Hyderabad, Bangalore and Mumbai.

My Journey with Lemon tree started last year (March or April 2013 dont remember excat month) when my company's guest house was full and theyarranged for a stay in Lemon tree Hitech city . All in all I was very impressed by the courteousness and overall hospitality of the staff.

I left the hotel after 3 days of stay and after reaching back chennai realized that I have eft my gold chain and Ridraksh in the bathroom .

I called them - the person at the front desk said he will call me back in 30 mins -- called me back and said that they have found it after i left and depositied it in the hotel safe. and i could collect it on my next trip -- WOW -- Dont remeber the name of the housekeeping staff who depositied it but nevertheless what an experience

Since then I have stayed almost 25 times in LTree Hyderabad and everytime they are better than the last time .

I dont remeber all the staff I have interacted with by name but some of the noteworthy names are Azhar, Dharam, Jenny. Mohit Raghav(Frint desK), ARUN (F&B Manager) , Vishal, Unni Sarita, Neeraj, Ali, Samata, Vaishali (Citru cafe) and Ranjan House keeping ... As I mentioned these are names at the top of the mind but predominantly every one in the hotel I interacted with comes alive whenever they interact with a customer -- wowo what a way to be .

It is not that my stay has been completely trouble free in HYderabad Lemon tree , there have been issues at times with housekeeping or room access not opening etc , but the best part is these guys acknowledge when they goof up and immediately get on the job to set it right ... it is not a perfect world so am not complaining

What will stand out in this property is the Genuinness of the staff ... without any plastic smiles ...

and last but not the leaset the food at Citrus is pretty good ... and the canneloni Pizza from Chef Neeraj -- is out of the world ....

So much so that now company has a standing instruction if I travel in a city which has lemontree , by default i should be booked there .

Hope these guys open in Mumbai soon.

1961,Nov 2014,"If it is Hyderabad, for me it will be none other than Lemon Tree Premier","In my opinion/experience, one of the very few hotels that truly believes ‘Guest is God’ and instills that philosophy into to every single employee. Luxury made affordable, is another unique feature of Lemon Tree / Red Fox. Food! Thanks to the hard working chefs who reached our hearts through our stomach. It was tasty, varied and healthy! Infrastructure! From the hot shower 24/7 to the LED, handpicked and well maintained. ‘Hospitality’ is a very tough industry to be in but Lemon Tree / Red Fox is ‘redefining’ the definition! Strategically located – it is just a quick walk to our office, in orbit mall etc. Last but not least - The People at LT/RF who ensures LT/RF is what it is today! Gyanesh @ Red Fox, Srinivas Kadadi @ LT, Arun Gupta @ LT, Vishal @ LT Cafe, Chef Himanshu, Unni @ LT Cafe and the Management personnel (Mr. Pandit, Mr. Narotam, Mr. Ausekar, Santhosh Kumar @ RF).

Thanks to the board, for empowering individuals who are differently abled. What a way to give back to the society? Hats off!

I would highly recommend a stay at Lemon Tree / Red Fox hotels to truly experience their impeccable service.

Note: I have stayed in both Red Fox / Lemon Tree for over months and its adds to the challenge of consistently delivering to the expectation. LT/RF has never disappointed me.

Thanks,

Atleast one shelf is out of reach. I did not reach out there and check if it is wiped clean :-). The soap/shampoo dispensers in the washroom are very inconveniently placed and difficult to use.

1977,Sep 2014,Good hotel for those working near HITEC City area,"this hotel is a good option for those having some work near HITEC City area of Hyderabad. This is quite far from tourist locations or main city area. So if want to experience Hyderabad culture and cuisine stay in the city but if working in HITEC area then this is indeed a great option.

This hotel is across the road from TCS, 10-15 minutes drive from Hyderabad International Convention Centre, and lots of business offices close by.

Hotel is very good. Cheaper red fox hotel is in same premises. Lemon tree very neat, clean and refreshingly lemon fresh! Rooms big in size and room service v good. Good working desk as well as relaxing couch. Rooms very comfortably done up.

Smart messages, graffiti will keep enchanting you all around! Breakfast buffet is very good, very impressive.

Staff very helpful, smiling and warm. Azhar needs a special mention on the front desk.

Internet is very expensive. For those who want to buy supplies, there are no shops in immediate vicinity. So please take an auto to Madhapur for INR 50-60 and buy stuff from market. Auto people will demand 150-200 but 50 is fine.

Culturally this place is not really anything close to Hyderabad. Most residents are from elsewhere working for big corporations etc so prices have gone up.

1984,Sep 2014,Not a good experience .. But a Fantastic one!,"I stayed at Lemon Tree Hyderabad this Friday (19th Sep) and wanted to share my experience and feedback with everyone.

First of all, I dont know why a lot of people have mentioned that this is a very good ""Business Hotel"". I would not think twice to get my family and stay over as it is one of the best services I have received in any hotel so far.

The staff are courteous, look after your needs and make it a point to do thier best to accommodate you well.

I had the pleasure of meeting one such front desk staff named ""Shyantan"". A last minute itenary change made me reach the hotel @ 11 AM , I know the policy was 2 PM check-in but I also had to leave to work immediately. I was in two minds if i should maybe come back later as I had only 30 minutes gap. Shyantan ensured that I got a room ready , not to forget that I was a demanding customer who wanted a room in upper floors, a smoking room, Masterbed as well as a Bathtub.

The bathtub was not available as i made all these requests after reaching the hotel, I was asked to wait while the room got ready and to my surprise Shyantan managed to get me a room with a bathtub. That is going out of the way to ensure your customers are happy.

I couldnt stay long at the hotel as I had to leave to work in 30 minutes and came back only at 2 AM in the middle of the night and checked out from the hotel next noon.

The breakfast buffet was elaborate but was equally tasty and of good quality. The team was always checking on you if you needed anything else.

The cab I booked from the hotel to arrive to the hotel was good , nice interactive driver who was friendly, however the cab I booked to go back - The driver was very grumpy and did not even speak when I spoke to him, not sure if he was having a bad day.

Overall , I think it is a hotel that is definitely recommended not just for business trips but also family vacations.

I am coming back to Lemon Tree on 30th Sep again for a week's visit and I hope to get the same hospitality from them.

5. Nice swimming pool (but need to bring down the chlorine smell)
6. The Best Part - They employ people who are 'differently abled'. Full marks to LemonTree on social front.

Scope for improvement:
1. Toiletries - No body wash available, even when requested! The handwash/shampoo holders are not properly fitted and they often come out!
2. I had serious issue with the towels provided, they looked old and off-white and I did complain about this. Only during my last visit, i found them good and new. One thing I would strongly recommend this hotel to look into.

1994,Sep 2014,Great Place to Stay for HITEC Visits,"I've stayed at the Lemon Tree about four separate times over a period of a month.
The hotel is well situated for access to HITEC city offices. Note, though, that this does not necessarily equate to walking distance. You will need a cab, or other mode of transport to and fro. However, you are very unlikely to be caught up in traffic snarls.
A great aspect of this place is, unlike other such hotels, the wifi signal is really strong. On the occasions I had to work from the room, the signal held really well, supporting a VPN connection and reasonably heavy use.
Staff, as a rule, were well turned out, and eager to go the extra mile, which I found a pleasant thing when away from home.
If you're staying here, and find you have the time, note that they have a decent DVD library downstairs. You'd be better off going to the reception and browsing from what is available, rather than trying to order off the printed catalog.
Food is pretty good - I particularly enjoyed the dosa counter for breakfast. They also do a strong 'South Indian filter' coffee, which I took a liking to. I'm not an expert, and can't vouch for its authenticity, but it was strong and tasty :-) The room service people seem keen to offer suggestions on what you can have, and I've generally gone with their opinions - again, I've enjoyed the food.

The amenities at the hotel helped me feel comfortable during my trip and I know it will be difficult being back home without all of the pampering I experienced in the hotel :).

The staff at the Lemon Tree goes above and beyond. Everyone went out of their way to make sure that I felt welcomed and that I was comfortable. Arjun, Safdar, Rohit, Joe and Jenny were always especially helpful.

The Citrus Cafe staff (the main restaurant) were the best! Vishal, Sarita, Vishali and the rest of the staff would accompany during meals to make sure I didn't have to sit alone (dining alone for several weeks can get lonely) but they were determined to make sure I never felt lonely.

Everyone in security as well as the hotel drivers were always friendly and respectful.

I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone and I hope to have the opportunity to stay here again!

Thanks for the excellent experience,

2001,Aug 2014,Refreshing [as Lemon],"Our stay, although very short, at the Lemon Tree Hotels Hitec City Hyderabad was comfortable and refreshing. The hotel is conveniently located at a 30-45 minutes drive from the airport. We were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves quietly upgraded to a junior suite at the time of check-in. The suite was tidy and compact, yet elegant.

For lack of time, had to miss a dip in their fine-looking pool that’s on the 11th floor.

Food was wonderful both at Kebab Theatre and Republic of Noodles. And the service-first class!

It was indeed a pleasure to see everyone from the gatemen to the stewards discharging their duties so very professionally; and with a smile. Vaguely remember that Lemon Tree Hotels have a ‘No tips’ policy.",4.0,August 2014,family,Franchisu,34,22,"Bengaluru, India",,4.0,,4.0,4.0,

2009,Aug 2014,Feedback,"I travelled to HYD on a business trip and my organisation had booked me into the Lemon Tree for a week. I arrived late into HYD due to my flight being delayed and the airline lost my baggage. I eventually left the airport and the hotel driver was still waiting even after an hour and half. This was great. Once I got checked into the hotel I spoke to one of the senior managers about my situation of no luggage, his name was Krishnan. He went out of his way to track my bags down with the airline and indeed the baggage handlers at HYD airport, whose service was less than poor and whom did not have a clue to the location of my luggage. Krishnan even arranged for me to go to the airport its self with one of his drivers to see if we could track said luggage down and try and make sense from the situation. To me he went over and above his line of duties and was very professional in is approach to help. After several days my luggage came. Krishnan even made a complaint on my behalf to the baggage drop rep. Overall the stay at the hotel was excellent, hotel was clean and offered all that a business traveller requires. The staff are friendly and helpful and the food was good, with a choice of several restaurants. The Asian one was in my eyes the best. All in all a pleasant stay. One thing to note when you are using the hotel taxi service, ensure they fully understand the location of pick up from your office, as a number of times the driver went to the incorrect gate on the wrong road after I had told them 3 times the correct location. It is perhaps recommended that the drivers have some further training in this area.

2016,Aug 2014,Good hotel- could be improved,"I stayed at the Lemon Tree Premier while attending a conference at the HICC centre nearby.
The room was clean functional in all respects, and the servicing up to a good standard. Internet access as functional the laundrey service good for the price.
The Citrus restaurant was very good and the breakfast service inlcuded in the price was excellent- I especially enjoyed the masala dosas which the chef would make on demand while you watched.
On the downside,the cost of drinks via room service was very pricey(over 200 rupees for a can of tonic water) and the service at the reception desk was often slow, which was annoying if you were in a hurry,
One incident was especially annoying and spoiled an otherwise very satisfactory stay.
I was leaving quite early in the morning and made apoint of ensuring the bills were all paid the night before and then checked with the desk that all was in order when I handed my card-key in and checked out (morning 21 July). I set off in the taxi rather pushed for time, but as it U-turned to get onto the main road, it was flagged down by Lemon tree security who insisted I return to the hotel , saying I had not paid.
This needless delay was not only humiliating, it nearly made me late for the flight. It was doubly annoying because the reception manager on the desk had had ample opportunity to check I'd paid my bill (as well as the hotel having my credit card details) when I checked out and was waiting for the taxi.
It's a shame that one moment of managerial idiocy spoiled my stay- but assuming this was an isolated incident it would not stope me recommending Lemon Tree Premier as a good option for travellers staying in HiTec city.",4.0,July 2014,business,AntonyT,46,40,Auckland,3.0,4.0,,,,4.0
2017,Aug 2014,Pure as lime;blissfully satisfying - Anil Goel,"If you're booked into a hotel in the heart of Hi-Tech city, you are unlikely to have time to do much other than grab a good breakfast in the morning, and crash in your suite at night after a long, tiring day at work. When you are making such a trip, what you are really looking for is some serenity. Unfortunately, most hotels, in their eagerness to please, tend to overwhelm. Lemon Tree Premier is refreshingly understated elegance and perfect convenience. The rooms are thoughtfully furnished with all the necessary amenities you would need, the staff is genuinely warm and pleasant, the facilities are excellent, and the breakfast spread is wonderful.

And there are two things that I was totally swept away by

1) As soon as I entered the suite, around midnight, I was greeted by a refreshing lemony aroma. It was a long day, I was tired, and I had not even registered the name of the property fully but the moment I opened the door and the burst of lime hit me it all fell in place. Was out like a log before I knew it . I am an early riser so I got up groggily and sauntered into the bathroom the next morning and sleepily peeled off the packet containing the soap to be hit for the second time with the freshness of lime. The square bar of lemony soap looks, feels and smells like it has been made straight out of lime. The story was complete. The Lemon Tree branding had registered for good. I think I actually imagined the soap lather washing into the drain to be made of lemon fibres. I don't know if I just happened to be in a receptive state or the entire experience has been designed in that sequence but it works, it really works. All the qualities of cleanliness, purity and good health that the memory of lime invokes are impressively replicated in the experience. Extremely impressed.

2) After enjoying sumptuous breakfast for two days in a row accompanied by extremely warm, attentive and efficient service I was moved beyond words to learned from Mr. Safdar at the front desk that almost 40% staff including F&B comprise people with hearing disabilities. I couldn't believe and can't believe till now that these boys and girls, whichever from the abundant staff at the citrus these were, were indistinguishable from the others as they answered becknowns, provided clarifications and scurried around with dishes. I learned that Lemon Tree is in fact working hard to expand services to provide even more opportunities to marginalized folks. Full respect.

Lemon Tree Premiere at Hyderabad is a precious experience in today's mindless age, and Lemon Tree promoters and management are clearly an endangered species of businessmen that are probably giving back more than they are getting from the hard work they put in every day.

From the time we arrived at the hotel, I was very impressed by the warmth and hospitality of the front desk staff. I was upgraded from a superior room to a junior suite and had a courtesy early check-in. It could have been that it was not peak season, but nevertheless it was a great welcome. Special mention to be made of Safdar who was extremely helpful.
The suite was clean, comfortable and very attractive. The entire hotel is very eclectically decorated and I particularly got a kick out if the framed t-shirts with funny quotes...puts a smile on your face. The artwork and decor is wonderful. Free Wi-Fi was an added advantage. The breakfast buffet was fantastic with great variety. My dining experience at the Kebab restaurant was wonderful too. The staff was attentive and very hospitable. It was a bit disturbing to hear a gentleman at the next table complain for half an hour about his soup that was not served in time. I think it was a bit overdone and rude, because we had a very pleasant experience.

The room was one of the nicest that I have ever stayed in. It had a nice, comfortable bed, two flat-screen televisions, and a small ""living room"" area. I ordered room service the night I arrived, and the pasta dish was to die for! Perhaps I was over-hungry from the trip, but it tasted phenomenal to me! And, at only about $10 US dollars, I was truly in awe.

I strongly believe that the reason I had such a great experience in India was largely because of the accommodations at the Lemon Tree.

2045,Jul 2014,"Actually, Really Good Food","In Hyderabad for a conference during the brutal June heat, I was fortunate to stay at the Lemon Tree Hotel. Arriving at 3 AM after a long flight, my greeting was personable, gracious and accommodating. I learned that my room had been upgraded because my reservation at the adjacent Red Fox Hotel had been overbooked. I happily accepted. My room was modern, clean and comfortable, with the standard amenities that all worked.

Hyderabad is noisy, busy place with heavy traffic for 21 of 24 hours/day. Located on a main thoroughfare, close to many of the corporate headquarters, the Lemon Tree is a respite of (relative) quiet, openness and ease. Although there seemed to be more staff than needed, all were pleasant and knowledgeable.

I was surprised that the food at the hotel was consistently varied and quite good. The buffets, both morning and evening, had a range of Indian cuisine, much of which I had not had the opportunity to taste before. In fact, I asked the chef to provide me with a recipe for one of the fish dishes I enjoyed.

Overall, the Lemon Tree was a good, reasonably priced experience.",4.0,June 2014,solo,papajk,39,14,New York,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

2060,Jun 2014,Let down!,"I stayed in Lemon Tree Hotel in Hyderabad for 2 days while on a business trip. The hotel was supposed to be the premium version of the Red Fox hotel, which is housed in the same building.

While the rooms were pretty decent, I was surprised by few things

1. The items in the dinner buffet were never replenished. I could see some of the guests repeatedly reminding the waiters to replenish some items and even picking up arguments over that.
2. I ordered for 2 rotis and that was never served. After waiting for 30 minutes, I asked the waiter who said that I never ordered it. Eventually, further 20 minutes later I was served with what I had asked for, but I had finised my dinner by that time.
3. On both the days of my stay, I asked for the ironing board and domestic iron, which was never supplied. They didn't have the courtesy of informing me that it would take time or it is not available. But, they told that it would send that in 5 minutes, which never happened.
4. Worse, couple of times while requesting for the domestic iron - the phone was not picked up, neither by the Front Desk nor by the Housekeeping.
5. Towels in the bathroom were not clean. I could see soap stains and I had to use my own towel.
6. As a standard practice, when our company makes the hotel booking, laundry for 2 items per day is included in the package. When I checked with the Front Desk for the confirmation of the above, they denied that it is part of the package and only after I insisted that it is part of the standard package, they reluctantly agreed.

These were obviously not show stoppers. But when you think that you are checking into a premier hotel and are badly let down, it leaves a very bad taste.",2.0,June 2014,business,Chakra_Sampath,45,33,"Bengaluru, India",5.0,1.0,3.0,5.0,5.0,2.0

2092,Apr 2014,Security Breach,"I ,a lady,stayed in this hotel recently a week back.I had booked this hotel considering its proximity to HITEX where I was to attend a conference.I left the hotel at 8.30 in the morning for the conference where i was busy the whole day.I reached my hotel at about 9 pm at night and when I opened the door of my room I was taken aback.There were clothes and luggage of a male in my room.I was so frightened that I screamed and ran down to the manager at the reception.First they did not believe and then gave me an excuse that the man had told them that he would be sharing the room with me.can you believe this brazen lie? An unkown person tells the hotel reception that he wants to share the room with some unkown person and that also of opposite gender and without verifying the facts the hotel people allotted him my room.I was shocked at this moment.I had booked this room solely for myself and how could they let such a thing happen.The key is either with me or with the reception.So I thought that the hotel staff was lying as it seemed their mistake(?? or some malafide intention).The staff at the reception did not allow me to talk to their senior manager as they did not give me the phone number.One of the staff went up to my room and when he saw that there was luggage of some male,they quitely asked me to move to another room.The room which i was moved to was a far smaller room and so I had to make some hue and cry or else at this hour of the night nothing would happen,In the mean time my husband could contact the senior manager who then came to my help and i was shifted to a suite.But still they were unable to clarify as to why this security breach.You can imagine how I must have spent the night when I was so much terrified and shaken.The next day the senior manager then told me that it was the mistake of their staff.I dont know what to believe.At check out these callous people had the odesity to ask me for payment of the room tariff.They should thank their stars that i did not lodge an FIR against them as this was serious matter.
No doubt the hotel is near the convention centre but safety is more important than distance.This experience is a red herring for the solo females who would consider staying at this hotel.",1.0,March 2014,solo,karan1,20,9,delhi,4.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,3.0

They are spic and span and absolutely pleasant...maybe something abt the citrus aroma which really soothes u when u enter.
The citrus cafe is run efficiently. Manager serving u at the table. Chefs are good and food satisfies all ur palates.
Room service by Akhtar and his boss Ms Janette was wonderful. U thought of something and even in a full hotel they served u in 10 min.
All kudos to the Resident Manager Mr. Reginald Corbett. Courteous to a fault.we dont get managers at the lobby managing hands on the huge unrully load of guests at the conference.

2099,Mar 2014,Good Hotel Except a for a Rewards Program,"This was my first time staying at the Lemon Tree Premier Hotel in Hyderabad. My stay extended to almost 40 days from 14 Jan 2014 to 22 Feb 2014. The hotel has very strategic location is Hitech City and is easily approachable – the hotel is a land mark in itself which make travelling a bit more convenient. The rooms are clean, staff is polite and food in Republic of Noodles is excellent. I must appreciate the willingness of the Hotel staff at Citrus Café and Republic of Noodle to customize food preparation and portion sizes per our preferences – am I am thankful for Mr. Chakma (Republic of Noodles) and Mr. Amit (Citrus Café) for their cordiality. Also, the hotel gym is good and is well taken care of. Overall, the staff impresses you with their professional demeanor.
The hotel has (in my experience) one of the worst rewards program and left us with a bitter and memorable one – taste, when I along with my colleague settled a bill for 80 nights (40 nights each). We were under the sweet impression that one gets a complementary night every five night spent at the hotel. Later we were told, especially when we were checking out, that one needs to check out and check back in every week to avail of complementary nights – a clear instance of cheap reward program (as if customer will know by himself that he needs to check out). Also, over my long stay at hotel, we were not offered either complementary beverages or drinks, which are quite common or customary practice in the same tier hotels for guests who stay longer than two weeks. I called customer care twice regarding this, they said they are sorry, will speak to their seniors and get back me. They never did – I am still waiting. Therefore, one must think and think hard before choosing the hotel if the stay is long. After all this, all I have is some 10,000 pts in my rewards account which are not enough to get even one complementary night at the hotel – not that I am desperate for a night there.
Otherwise, as far as accommodation is concerned, the hotel is among the better places in the city.",4.0,January 2014,business,Rajwardhan D,4,1,"New Delhi, India",4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0

I think its a great upscale, full service hotel that offers fantastic VFM.

Pros:

Excellent location
Well constructed property
Excellent rooms, amenities
Great gym, beautiful swimming pool deck on the premium 11th floor (my favorite floor, they are nice enough to upgrade me to it on all my visits)
Great breakfast at Citrus (buffet dinner, a l a carte are very good too)
Great food at Republic of Noodles, Slounge is good for lounging around with drinks
Really , really good service from EVERYONE - courteous, efficient and not the ""let's fleece the customer for everything or be nice to get tips"" type
Excellent laundry service, don't think I've seen my suits and shirts ever come back sharper. Resonable rates too.
Fast, steady wi-fi
Excellent bed, linen, and bathroom

Cons :
Not many.
Lack of an in-house barber at their otherwise good Spa. Going out to get a haircut and shave is a bit bothersome
I do like their hotel vehicle drops to nearby locations, but I wasn't too thrilled about paying Rs. 300 each way for a 1 minute journey to Cyber Gateway. Thats 600 rupees for travelling two kilometres. A couple of complimentary rides to the nearby offices for inhouse guests would be a great benefit.

Also, I've got to recognize Shubham from the Front Desk, and Amit from Citrus for their excellent service mindset. These guys make returning to Lemon Tree that much more pleasant.
My last trip, I checked out at 9 AM to attend a conference at the Novotel. At noon I got a little sick and desperately wanted to lie down. I zipped back to the hotel and asked if they woud be ok to allow me to use the room on an extended checkout basis. I was expecting a little bit of resistance, I got none. I had the key to a room in 30 seconds, slept till 5 PM, and wasn't charged a single penny. It's this sort of thing which builds customer loyalty.

3. Accommodating and prompt service staff, always wear a smile!
4. If you are a frequent traveler (which I am) you will be welcomed, remembered and get the same room where you stay usually.
5. If you have food choices, the chef is accommodating and ready to serve your preferred choices.
6. Love the fact to see that the hotel believes in corporate giving and equality in employment, you will find servers who are hearing impaired and will serve you with a smile!!! kudos to that.

Only wish there were more food choices on Menu for Jain, Vegetarians, so the chef dose not have to make exceptions :)))))

Keep up the good work!!!

2134,Feb 2014,Excellent!,"I usually do not write reviews for hotels, but my stay in Lemon Tree is definitely worth writing a review. Right from day one I felt very warm and welcomed at this hotel. The room I stayed was a deluxe suite which is top of their line rooms. The room was very spacious, very well lit with a good view of the Hi Tech City and above all very immaculate. The furniture including the bed in the room were very well maintained and looked brand new. Room service is top notch with people always helping you with a smile.

Their Citrus restaurant hosts buffet 4 times a day: breakfast, lunch, dinner and midnight buffet.I had a chance to taste all their buffets except the midnight buffet. I should say their buffet caters people with all types of palate. Their spread includes American, Asian and Indian. Again all the servers, chefs and managers serve you with love, care and a very warm smile. It is in this restaurant I got to meet Mr. Amit who manages this restaurant. He is a very friendly and caring person who always greets you with a smile and makes sure you leave the restaurant happy and tummy full. Thank you Amit for feeding me!

And finally I would like to thank Mr. Arun and Mr. Narottam for making my stay in Lemon Tree very comfortable, safe and exciting!

Cons:

-very few electrical outlets in room and none had built in adapters like the other hotels I have stayed in over here.
- there was no mirror anywhere near an outlet so if you are female and want to use flat iron, it's tough because no mirror. I had to prop up my iphone on the desk and tried to
See what I was doing using photo app! And this was a women's floor.
- restaurants were not very good. They were very mediocre. Breakfast place was decent but service wasn't great.
- shower was a bit odd like a separate room.

pros:
- very clean
- rooms were comfortable
- pretty decent amenities - loofah, etc

The food is great providing options for even folks like myself with some serious restrictions on what I can eat. I've eaten several times at each of the restaurants and also at the bar within the hotel.

Each time I arrive in Hyderbad from the US, I'm treated incredibly well, the staff addresses me by name each time and it's as close to home as I could be when travelling so far from home.

I can't say enough about the staff, I wish I could remeember all the names. I'd meant to write this review when I returned from my trip, but it's now been a few months, so I apologize for not providing proper credit by name.

2158,Jan 2014,Great service,"-- This is based on 2 stays at the hotel this month (Jan 2014). Each stay around 8-9 days.

-- The hotel is located in HiTech City - surrounded by IT company offices. I chose this hotel due to it's proximity to a customer location. I was inclined towards choosing the Westin (which is quite nearby and was priced around the same) - but the gym of this hotel had the equipment i needed.

-- The location is quite ok - there's a place which has Subway and KFC and an irish bar - around half a KM away. The famous ""Paradise Biryani"" joint is also walking distance. You'd need an auto rickshaw to take u to places like Madhapur and InOrbit for more eating / shopping options - each just a few KM away (40 rupees on an auto).

-- I like this hotel. It may not be a 5 star - But the rooms are clean and spacious; The linen changed daily; the service is nice - everyone smiles back and is courteous and is willing to help. The walls everywhere have these frames with jokes and funny anecdotes that brought a smile to my face.

-- I did have an issue with the internet connection during my second stay - it kept dropping. Seems there's a wireless coverage issue on the 11th floor. 8th floor was better.

-- EXCELLENT hospitality and customer service was shown by the staff at the restaurant ""Citrus"". The food was great - and the team went the extra mile in customising it towards my liking each morning. Appreciate the hospitality shown by the team.

It took me around 30-35 mins to reach the airport as the highway is close by.

Good ambience and food. Breakfast though according to me could have more variety.
Complimentary package was well explained when I reached the hotel and was different than that was initially mailed to me. But was much better than that was communicated earlier. Hence, think there could be communication right from the confirmation of booking.

Query to the call centre mandated credit card number or initial payment of room charges which was later clarified as not required as it was held on company guarantee. Again felt this was needless of corporate bookings.",4.0,December 2013,business,LeenaRG,23,15,Mumbai,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0

2208,Nov 2013,Home away from home for two weeks,"I recently traveled to Hyderabad for business and I stayed at the Lemon Tree Premier in HITEC City. When you first walk in to the hotel the scent of lemons is strong and it carries through to the room. The hotel is very clean and the staff go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.

The room was very clean and comfortable. I was glad to see that the room had tile and wood flooring instead of carpet. The bed was comfortable and smelled faintly of lemons, which was actually quite relaxing. I guess a difference between bedding in India and the US is that the bed didn't have a top sheet. It had a bottom sheet and a duvet, which seemed odd to me. But a quick call to the front desk had the bed changed more to my liking.

The laundry service was top notch. I would leave my laundry in the bag provided and when I returned in the evening it was returned clean and neatly folded.

The restroom was also very nice. I was surprised at how comfortable it was based on my other restroom experiences in India. Although I brought everything I needed, anything I could need was provided. Even a fresh comb each day. The shower was clean and roomy, and the additional handheld shower head was a nice touch.

The food in the hotel is excellent! The Indian restaurant has many varieties of kebabs, curries and biriyani. Biriyani is a Hyderabad staple, and they do it well. I had the same server for many nights, and he was very excited to see me each day. it really made me feel welcome. The Thai restaurant is also good, with a large selection. And don't forget their Citrus cafe, with its many international dishes. They'll even try their best to make you what you want if it isn't on the menu. The head chef is always around and he genuinely tries to make sure that you have a great meal. I also enjoyed the lounge. The selection is about as good as you will get in Hyderabad, and the staff is very attentive.

The only real downside to the hotel is the exterior noise. But there's really not much they can do about it. Indian drivers love their horns, and the sound of horns can be heard in the room at night. I was on the 11th floor, as high as you can get, and the traffic was still audible. It isn't bad, really, but the rush hour in that area extends past 9 pm and given the location of the hotel you will hear the traffic. It does quiet down overnight, with the occasional bus horn piercing the silence. But I don't think there's anywhere in Hyderabad you could go and not hear horns.

The only other issue is that, with the location, walking to an off site restaurant for dinner is a challenge. But the hotel has reasonable car service. The drivers are very nice and the cars are very clean and well maintained. However, walking to an office building in HITEC City is a breeze, as it is very convenient to the likes of Dell and Oracle and a host of other tech companies. You call walk to the Dell and Oracle offices in about 10 minutes. It is also very close by car to Inorbit mall, and the Chili's there hit the spot when I couldn't handle another Indian meal.

Overall I would recommend it. It was a great experience and the price couldn't be beat. I will stay again when I go back.",4.0,November 2013,business,somemadguy,1,,"Charleston, South Carolina",5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0

India's not an easy place to live or work in, but we felt safe, at ease, and take care of at the Lemon Tree. I felt like there was a community of people I could really trust and who would really try to help me out.

THE HOTEL--
Lobby: Very clean, spacious, and equipped with a small cafe to sit and relax in

General decor: Clean and fresh, although each restaurant has its own theme for decorations :)

Bathrooms: Moderate sized, conveniently laid out, sparkling clean

Beds: On the firmer side, pillows were a bit flat

Temp control: Wall unit with a dial; power regulated by having your key in the slot

Amenities: Generic shampoo/conditioner on a shower wall mount, lemon-scented lotion and soaps, full length mirror, and if you needed anything like detergent/sewing kits/cotton swabs/DVD player/HDMI cable etc. they were more than happy to provide!!

Room Service: Fantastic!!! The hotel had three restaurants (Western, Asian, Indian) and the food was delicious at all of them. They'd let you mix and match between the restaurants and started to memorize my orders when I called down.

Gym: Great gym, complete with personal trainer there to assist if you needed him.

Pool: Rooftop pool was awesome in the hot Hyderabad weather; there was always music playing or we'd bring our own speakers. They'd let us use the pool and lounge area late at night too, even after hours.

Spa: Massages without music was a little weird, but I went anyway.

Internet: Good; could be slow during peak hours though.

Service: AMAZING. I loved all of the hotel staff and got to know most of them personally, from the housekeepers to the restaurant chefs to the room service people to the front desk and security. They were all wonderful people and so eager to serve and accommodate all of our strange or complicated requests.
They'd leave us towel animals and lemon-tree stuffed animals, buy us chocolate chip cookies and deliver to our room when they overheard us saying we missed cookies, get us birthday cakes, help us map out the city...all sorts of sweet and thoughtful things.

I loved this hotel. I visited some Westin's, Hyatt's, and Radisson Blu's while I was out there and those were great too, but there was something wonderful about this mid-sized hotel and its people.

The rooms sadly don't have a carpet, but, wood on its floor but, the rooms are quite good in its size and adequacy.

The best thing I liked about this hotel was they had Soy Milk on the breakfast buffet! This is the first hotel in India that cares for people like me who are intolerant to lactose.

The staff who clean the room have their sense of art intact when they create beautiful designs with towels and bedspreads.

2228,Oct 2013,Great 3-month stay! Republic of Noodles,"I stayed from March - May for business reasons and was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness of the rooms at the Lemontree and the friendliness of the staff.

The chefs Saroj and Himanshu were fantastic and offered to make anything I wanted whether it was on or off the menu. They really went out of our way to make us feel at home, which meant a lot since this was my first extended trip outside of the United Sates (and my first time in India). Saroj is an excellent chef at the Republic of Noodles. He even let me go to his kitchen and taught me how to make their delicious Pad Thai.

The rooms are great- very clean and spacious enough. Everything here smells like lemons- a little overbearing but I didn't mind too much as there are much worse scents than that of lemon.

Manmohan, although he isn't working at the Lemontree anymore, was a fantastic personal trainer at the gym. He spent time with me to create a workout routine.

Ultimately, I was very happy with the Lemontree. It made my three month stay in India much more comfortable and I would recommend it as a value hotel that is clean, comfortable, and safe.",5.0,March 2013,business,James S,2,,San Diego,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0

2242,Oct 2013,Republic of Noodles is good,"My wife and I decided to pay visit to Republic of Noodles few Sundays back for dinner. We stay and work pretty close by but never thought of going there. As we reached the restaurant, we were impressed by the effort management had put in the decor. Lemon Tree is not a 5-star hotel and so were not expecting the restaurant to be very well done. But we were positively surprised. Good luck! we thought.

We were wll received and taken to our table. It immediately struck us that the place was totally empty. It was 9 ppm and you expect lot guests, and maybe some waiting as well. But this was not the case. Strange, we thought. We were handed the menu and instantly liked it. There aren't many places in Hyd that serve SE Asian cuisine. Since my wife is vegetarian, we did ot have many options to choose from. But still, we thought we had good options to choose from. After deliberations, we ordered a clear soup (dnt remember the name). As it came, we could smell the nice aroma. Good! we thought. And good it was. Will definitely recommend it to others.

Next, we ordered Vietnamese rolls (I think that is what they were called). We thought they would be like spring rolls but they were bit different. Different, but good again. Definitely worth a try for the veggies out there. We then ordered red vegetable curry with thai fried rice. Both were well made. They tasted fresh. The servings were generous and we could not finish both of these. Finally, we decided to have some dessert. Some chocolate it had to be, as per my wife's wishes. So were ordered a chocolate mousse (I think?, or maybe it was called something else).

All in all, we thought the food was very good. Service was good too. Just that everything was taking some time to come. Maybe they were really preparing everything fresh. I just wonder why people dont come to the place. Maybe lunches are busier. Definitely recommend teh place.",4.0,September 2013,couple,nikhil_malhotra,228,80,"New Delhi, India",,4.0,,,,3.0

2265,Sep 2013,Nice business hotel in HITEC City,The Lemon Tree hotel is very clean and the staff are friendly and helpful. The location is great if you are working in Mindspace. The Lemon Tree's rooms are big and comfortable though the bed is too soft for my liking. Like other business hotels there is a charge for everything and overall diminishes the value of the hotel.,4.0,September 2013,,Jason M,16,2,,5.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,,3.0

2282,Aug 2013,A very good option for stay,"Hi everybody,

This is Raman. I have stayed for almost 8-9 months with lemon tree premier (hyderabad) and found it best suited. Initially my stay at Hyd was at Novotel (Airport), i literally ran from there and chose lemon tree for my prolonged stay and had absolutely no hastle.

The team there is really customer eccentric and focused. Among the large number of guests checked in, the team there focuses the need / requirement of every individual guest. Donot be surprised if they offer your breakfast on your table without u asking for it, just by tracking your pattern on selection of the dishes. You may also expect the cab having kept ready with no reminders.

Food & ambience are sober and good.

Rooms are very descent and good enough for having it chosen as your destination. Overall cleanliness of the hotel is also appreciable.

Lemon tree also has Slounge and Republic of china to serve you.

The hotel is well situated in Hyd. Mall, theatre in proximity. Good hangout places like Banjara Hills & Jublie Hills are all within 10 Kms radius making it convenient for you to choose to go to any other hotel or restaurant as per your mood.

Best for executives travelling for business and yes, the low price keeps it good for travellers too to select this as their stay.

On the whole I vouch for lemon tree premier hotel, hitec city, hyderabad.",5.0,July 2013,business,ramavadhani,1,,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0

The breakfast menu includes everything under the sun (you may ask the staff, if you don't find a particular item in the menu and they will arrange it for you)

The hotel is also equipped with amazing gym facility and swimming pool. A special mention of the gym instructor Umakanth, who takes good interest in guiding when you hit the gym.

They always take care of each and every member of your family even in presence of your absence. Every staff member whether it is security guard or receptionist or housekeeper always greet you with smile no matter how many times you meet them in the day. Rooms' decoration, bed comfort, facilities, cleanliness etc are of top class. Hotel's interior always catches your attention. They have many things to enjoy there like swimming pool, spa, bar etc. Hotel service is always very fast. You need not wait much for anything. Just call them and get the service done in a few minutes only. Buffet breakfast is also very good there. They have lots of varieties in the menu. And chefs also keep asking you if anything is not in the menu, they can cook it for you.

As a business hotel, it gets everything right. I stayed in a junior suite which as a sit out area with a wooden divider and a comfy bed. The room was well maintained, very clean and the staff service is impeccable. During check-in, one of the staff members suggested that i carry my own luggage to the room (which i thought was weird). During checkout, my feedback was taken in promptly and addressed - to me, that was great service to hear and address a concern.

The food is good too - the breakfast and dinner spread is large. A special mention is on the coffe during breakfast - none of that terrible 'black coffee sludge brewed hours ago and mixed with milk'. You get a barista cappucino which is as good (if not better) than any coffee chain.

2303,Jul 2013,Lemon Tree!! You've got a fan,"To be frank, i mean every word of it. Not because it provided me with the world class service or the best deal available (though that was also on platter). Not because of the friendly and courteous staff (oddly they treat you as if their jobs are dependent on your review). Neither because of the manager personally greeting you on your check in and check out (and at the same time remembering your preference and getting the same made available).

I simply enjoyed the stay at lemon tree for the sheer brilliant use of the resources it has at disposal. Not every hotel would care to have the soaps, shampoos and conditioners as a permanent fixtures in the bathroom! Not every hotel can dare to have their interiors filled with kid sized T-shirts carrying various cheeky one liners. Not every hotel would go the extra mile to give you a complete theme lifestyle where everything is based on citrus or lemon extracts (OK!! I agree several great hotels do it. But certainly not at this price point!)

Minuses, very few actually, maybe a not so great concierge service, in room dining options seem steep and minimal. But the HITEC city area within 1 km ( just down the road ) has all the upmarket dining and fast food joints one can crave.

We stayed in Lemon tree for a month with family. We were booked here by the company as part of relocation package and I was very apprehensive about it. We thought we will not be able to stay in a hotel for a month because it will be too uncomfortable with two kids and them starting school mid way. I have to commend the staff and management for making the month go by so quickly. We got two connecting rooms and the rooms were so big it felt like we had a small apartment for ourselves. Every need we had was met even before we asked. The housekeeping staff was excellent and we had clean rooms everyday. The staff at citrus cafe were very courteous and even after staying for 30 days they had the same enthusiasm on the last day as they had on the first day. We had the head chef Mr. Himanshu come and greet us every day and enquire if there is anything we needed and he would gladly do it for us. In the end i recommend this hotel if you are looking for a hotel with good food and great hospitality Lemon tree is your place.

2318,Jun 2013,"Nice hotel, good values","I used to live in Hyderabad in the 'noughties. I visited this city on business in May 2013 and decided to stay in this hotel which was recommended by friends knowledgeable about hospitality industry. I am glad I took their advice. The front office/lobby is spacious and the staff are welcoming. They did not look strained when I arrived close to midnight for my check-in. The room was a suite with an excellent bed. I slept well all three night I stayed.News was good on the food front. The restaurant on the ground floor has a great chef and the items were cooked and presented well. I had invited over a dozen friends for a meal and they enjoyed the meal and the ambience. The check in and check out processes were smooth and the bills were clear.I especially liked the hotel policy of not bundling WiFi in room bill- this, in India, mostly meant relatively poor access. When I pay, I know there is a strong likelihood that the bandwidth is delivered as promised.

If I had to cite one thing for improvement, I would mention the business center!",5.0,May 2013,business,Indie_Traveler66,9,4,"Vancouver, Canada",5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,5.0

Well equipped with all the equipment and a small and clean pool. The rooms are very clean and hygienic, with all basic amenities, the WIFI works well. The view from the rooms is nice, but for that you have to go to higher floors, otherwise you may get stuck up with seeing vehicles and buildings under construction. Breakfast is good with a lots of variety. The room service also provides a vide variety of preparations which are worth a try.
The only issue is the pool which closes down at 8 in the evening which of course is a bit early if you are planning to have a late night. The laundry service was also not impressive.

2320,Jun 2013,They are trying but have ample scope for improvement,"I was on a Business Trip and stayed here from 21 to 23-May'13 (02-nights). Apparently, everything is fine, but when you get into the finer details, a lot remains to be desired. In my case, the AC in the room was functioning much below capacity. They tried to repair it but could not. The GMs profusely apologised, and promised to ensure that it would never happen. this was my second visit, and I would believe them only after I have had a better experience, if I stay again. Usually all hotels and everybody in the service industry offers a lot of lip service when a deficiency is brought to their notice. I am not ruling out a possibility but will believe when things change at the ground level. My simple suggestion to them would be - Please check the room before you allot it. My booking was well in advance, and hence there is no reason why a little homework cannot be done by the hotel. The front level people are very humble and try out their best. The problem lies in the management.
The other point of disappointment was I was NOT able to watch the IPL matches which was going on. The management's justification was, if they had to subscribe to Sony (showing IPL), the room rates needs to be jacked up. I found this logic ridiculous.
The good things that I found was a very good pool, open 24 Hrs., cleanliness was pretty good, staff was courteous, and willing to help.",3.0,May 2013,business,KunalBanerjee,2093,99,"Mumbai, India",4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2.0

2326,Jun 2013,Business Stay at Lemontree Hyderabad,"I had heard a lot about Lemontree Hyderabad - and decided to give a try. While the overall stay was above average, several small things can be addressed by the staff / team to make the experience a lot better. Please note that this review would perhaps be more relevant to a business traveller.

On an early morning arrival - not unusual for business travellers, the breakfast - before checking in - can be offered as part of the package itself. This will save a lot of hassle around ""sir - you havent checked in yet; this breakfast will be charged; only the next day breakfast is complementary and so on"".

On Wi-Fi, there was a confusion since my agent had told me this was included in the tariff. Wi-Fi - in my opinion - should be treated similar to the complementary bottle of water that the hotel keeps in the room. No extra charge - period. The relief this gives is immense.

That said, food spread was very good - though we had arranged for early departure next day (15 min before the scheduled opening of the restaurant), there was no one to help us.

These small things fixed - would make this my recommended choice.

Thanks for reading the review.

2368,Apr 2013,"Clean, soulless business hotel with flawed policy","Stayed here for a few days while visiting our local business office.

Pros:

This hotel is very close to the HITEC area and very clean with good services. The gym is large for a hotel and has both weights and exercise machines. The rooftop pool is exceptional if not a bit out of place for both neighborhood and level of hotel. There are plenty of dining options and the rooms are large.

Cons:

The hotel is next to a busy street with an active gas station that seems be occupied 24/7 so the rooms are a bit noisy while trying to sleep (I wore earplugs while sleeping). My coworker described the hotel as ""soulless"" based on the lack of decor and the dorm-like rooms. And I had a particularly unusual experience at checkout: I needed to check out 2 days early due to a change in plans and was informed the reservation required payment for all of the nights of the original reservation. I've traveled to many countries on business and hadn't before experienced this policy. I'm unsure if this is local custom or hotel specific but either way it's unacceptable, especially for business. My company's negotiated rate at a higher star hotel just down the road is just a few rupees more and, based on this hotel's cancellation policy, we've removed the Lemon Tree from my company's list of recommended places to stay in Hyderabad.",3.0,April 2013,business,Shawn T,1,,"Menlo Park, California",3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,2.0

The room gave a very cosy feel. All amenities are organised well and have been fitted very nicely in the room.I liked the availability of a Yoga mat in the room (though this time I was hard pressed for time and couldnt make use of it ).

I was able to use the steam in their spa, for a charge, but privately. Went for a swim in their rooftop pool, and while the length is less for an avid swimmer, again it's private.

The Lemon tree is a small hotel complex. Not a lot of amenities except a spa (which seemed booked) and a roof top type pool. They also had a small pool table/bar upstairs next to one asian restaurant. they also had a buffet breakfast downstairs. Breakfast was ok. I didn't really care for the dinners at night. Compared to the novotel, didn't compare.

The hotel also had free wifi and great ac in the rooms. No problems with bugs or any other pests.

2424,Jan 2013,"Smelly dirty room, very loud, disorganized check-in & out process","Check-in:
Upon arrival, the check-in desk could not find my reservation, even though I had called and made sure they had it (I went through a travel agency so wanted to be sure). It took them almost 30 minutes to find a room for me. Later, one of my customers had the same issue (we did not use a travel agency for his reservation), I suppose something must be wrong with their online system. My very tall customer was stuck with a twin bed because of this.

Room:
I walk in the room and start choking. It's damp and smells like wet dog with lemon. The noise from the outside traffic is almost as loud as if I was outside. The internet purchase system is ridiculous, even if you pay for a few hours, the internet will go down and you have to pay AGAIN for the same hours. The shower had some brain stain in it, so I ran the hot water for a minute and it was gone - I guess they don't clean well at this hotel. Also I remember the layout of the bathroom didn't make much sense.

Food: First of all, room service is served on a very large tray that is very hard to get in and out of the door frame. Second of all, the thai food I had was very very spicy and very very sour, almost inedible. I can deal with spicy when I drown it with rice, but the sour was just too much. I went to bed hungry.

Check-out: While checking out, they ask you fill out a feedback card. As I was filling it out, a lady was peering over my shoulder and looking at what I was writing. If I wrote something negative, she would immediately ask me about it. Upon completion, I turn around and see three men standing behind me, all wanting to know what they had done wrong on my stay. This was very uncomfortable and unprofessional of the hotel to do. I simply restated what I had written on the card and they promised to change things, not that it matters as I will not stay here again.
I paid for my room and asked if they had already charged my card for the customers I had stay at that hotel. They said yes, so I went on my merry way. I got many frantic calls to my cell phone, right after one another, while at lunch. I finally answer and turns out they did not charge me for the customers and I would have to come all the way back to pay. Disorganized and inconvenient.

Final recommendation: Stay at the Westin. We went to dinner there and I was embarrassed that my customers got to see such a gorgeous hotel while ours was so mediocre. The Westin wasn't too different in cost, either.",2.0,December 2012,business,Roxyc100,35,27,"San Francisco, California",4.0,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0

Please note, hotel look very noisy at every where whether you are in restaurant or walking in corridor, In citrus restaurant sound of picking catlaries is very annoying.

Gym is not up to the mark but Gym Instructor Mr. Mohan is well trained with good exercise skills. Gym needs some more exercise equipment's, so that he can explore more to the guest. As explaining exercise with limited equipment's might be hard for him to explain to guest.

2429,Jan 2013,Good service but terrible conduct,"I chose Lemon Tree Premier primarily because of its location, pretty accessible from all corners of the city and also in a prime location. The Hotel Staff was really good while providing services. But when it comes to billing, I had a very terrible experience. The tariff that was mentioned in the proforma invoice was entirely different from that mentioned in the final invoice. I had agreed upon the tariffs for a set of rooms and without any intimation or communication, my guests were upgraded to rooms of higher tariff due to unavailability of rooms. Now that was something the Hotel Staff was supposed to communicate to me and seek my approval. They did not think it to be important to communicate the same and blatantly charged me with higher tariffs, though it was communicated that I wanted rooms of lower tariffs. This landed me in a big trouble. It was good that I had exchanged emails with the staff and I had sufficient proof for the same. When questioned about the same, the Hotel Staff just became very defensive and tried to put me on the wrong side, without realizing that they were at fault. The Hotel Staff does not understand the value of the clients. In each of the invoices they provided, the name of the client was wrongly spelt, something that would not be accepted by my higher authorities and would have landed me in trouble. In spite of bringing it to their notice multiple times, the staff still continued with their callous nature of dealing with clients.
The Hotel Staff also did not mind embarrassing me in front of my guests several times regarding payments. I had to repeatedly ask them for providing me with the invoices but would never get them on time, leading to delayed payments to them, which when communicated to them, they went ballistic. I had informed them earlier that delaying invoices would cause a delay in processing the payments.
Also, the hotel lacks in internal communication. They charged me for utilities which were a part of the package that had been agreed upon. And it had to be brought to their notice that they did a mistake over there again.
But, I must say that the service that the Hotel provided during my stay were really good, in fact, value for money. But they way the hotel staff dealt with me with regard to payments and relationship, I think they still need to learn a lot.",1.0,December 2012,business,Karthik_KV,20,5,"Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India",4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,1.0

But the thing which really set me off is the quality of the food, which is served at the coffee shop (I think they called it the Citrus). Being out most of the day, I only had the dinner at the outlet and B'fast at times. The menu was quite repititive and they were not what you would expect in THAT hotel.

Though I must appreciate the Chef and F&B guys, who were very courtious and helpful at all times. To retain its standard it must improve the food quality.

Another matter that really upset me was that I had been requesting a higher floor room since I made the booking. But throughout my stay I was told that there are no vacant rooms, though I checked the net and found vacant rooms avilable.

Well the Shaving mirror in my room was not steady enough and I had to leave it finally as you need both your hands to shave. and the water in the shower area never drained, but I guess this cannot be corrected. I stayed at room # 204 or 5 I think.

The front desk is able to arrange transportation very quickly, and at all times of the day or night.

The restaurants are fantastic. The staff recognized me from a trip 5 months earlier, and every morning they'd have my ""usual"" order ready within minutes of my arrival. The Executive Chef, Himanshu, would regularly ask me how my meal was, and was very helpful when it came to navigating the local cuisine.

The rooms are clean, spacious, and an in-room safe is provided for valuables. Two liters of water a day are provided, which is a pleasant suprise. 30 minutes of wireless is complimentary, but I opted for the daily use for a fee - no bandwidth issues, and I was able to use WebEx, Skype, etc with minimal issues.

This restaurant came highly recommended and I can assure you that it was one of the best thai/ Malay/Indonesian meals I have had. Partly perhaps because I was tired of eating Indian food during my stay and really fancied something different.

To start, we had the prawns lightly sautéed with garlic and pepper (something like that...). Very good! We then got a red curry with sticky rice and a wok dish that our waiter recommended. The white wine served was chilled to perfection. The portions are big. The staff is very helpful.

A real gem. A real find. The setting was simple with a south East Asian ambience. It is good for a work dinner or post work dinner (after too many meetings).",5.0,November 2012,business,Pat S,70,19,,,5.0,,,,5.0

Found this business hotel, which was just 4 km from the Convention Centre quite convenient. When I checked in I was delighted to know that I had been upgraded to a Junior suite. As it was dinner time, I serarched the room menu card and ordered two of their signature dishes, Laksa – Curried noodle soup with chicken or shrimp and Lemon Tree Club Sandwich – with fried chicken, fried egg, cheese and crisp Bacon. Both were fantastic. They are also available in vegeterian versions. The morning breakfast spread were quite elaborate.

Hotel staff were eager to offer their help and were very courteous . One night when I was free, asked the staff at the gate to guide me to a nearest mall. They suggested that nearby InOrbit Mall, which has a Cineplex too, is just 2 km away and I can reach there by hiring a Auto Ricksaw (quite easily available at Hyderabad) by paying just Rs. 20-30 (less than half a dollar). The mall has an excellent food court serving both Indian and international foods.

Beds were comfortable. Everyday complimentary quality toiletries were replaced.

Only thing I found wanting that the quality of cable TV reception was poor and so as number of available channels.

However the internet can only be used on single device at a time. In this day and age thats very annoying and seems punitive in this day and age. There is also no wifi in the bar, restaurant or near the pool which is a shame.

The taxi service suffers from indian time syndrome. Being told that my taxi was 5 minutes away every 7 minutes for an hour is exceptionally annoying. This needs to stop. An honest time estimate enables you to make alternative arrangements if you need to rather than just getting increasingly frustrated. After a few days of this I simply started walking or taking Auto Rickshaws rather than dealing with the hotel desk staffs inability to estimate time.

2473,Oct 2012,"Good for short stays, but with a decidedly misogynistic tone","The good: rooms are small, but well apportioned with a full couch and a few desk spaces. The curtains block out all light which makes sleeping extremely easy. The in-room dining service is excellent and prompt, and if there are any wrong orders, they fix it immediately. Also, the front desk staff is attentive and also quickly fixed an over-billing issue in a very short amount of time.

The OK: Breakfast was good, if a little boring (I was there for 9 days, so YMMV). The different hotel restaurants provide a variety of meal choices, as well as in-room dining.

The Bad: there is a strain of anti-women and misogyny, combined with adolescent humor, which pervades all facets of the decor in this hotel. Off-color jokes about killing wives and jokes which demean women abound in the ground floor restaurant, which is hard to miss when they are on the walls and on the placemats. Who in their right mind thinks buying t-shirts with idiotic phrases such as ""Beer Belly in Training"" and framing them was a good decor idea?

In the end, this hotel is clean and neat, but I can't at all recommend it at all for those staying 2+ nights. Also, I won't be staying at this hotel again because of the rampant anti-woman material throughout the hotel - if a hotel could be compared to a person, this hotel is a slightly insecure adolescent trying to look cool by putting people down.",2.0,October 2012,business,BombayFlights,12,12,,3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0

And the most important is that you can see smile everywhere in their waiters' face.

I stayed in this hotel for over 1 month, every night or morning when I enjoyed my breakfast or dinner buffet, they can remember the special food style you used to order.
They will send some sunny egg or hot NAAN on your table automatically. It is sweet.
Anyway, the service is very good.

In addition, no doubt with clean room & clean water.

Also when I have no idea to go in the weekends, hotel can provide you a free tour guide and give you some suggestions & full car package you want to visit if you need. It is quite safe & easy to have a tour to visit some special tour in India. You don't need to worry how to find a taxi or travel problem.

2495,Sep 2012,Need to push them to serve you,"I stayed here for 02-nights during Sep'12. They are very rigid when it comes to anything and under no circumstances they ensure that you get anything more than the 30-minute complimentary wi-fi. When I just entered the hotel everybody was busy, but nobody even noticed that I needed a little help with my luggage. I had to remind them at the check-in counter that I had arrived, else, I would have kept on waiting. I stayed in room number 1022 and the check-in guy told me I got an upgrade but I don't think so. My experience was if you are humble, you are ignored; If you are a bit aggressive you are treated well. The people are very good, but it looks like management has given them certain instructions, which may not always be in favour of the guests. The restaurant experince on the first night was not very good. 2 staff members were just fiddling with the TV remote and no way I could watch the news channel. Surprising a channel like Times Now were missing from their list of channels. The check-out experience was horrible. It took me approx. 20 minutes to check-out. I was the only person at the counter when I checked out.
I felt that overall the management is very high handed. Take it or leave it attitude.

2498,Sep 2012,Service Fit for a King / President or VVIP,"I stayed for a total of 30 days at the LemonTree HYD and I must admit that it was a greater experience than I could have ever imagined. This was my first trip to India and I'm a very conservative American eater. To be honest, I arrived with a little disappointment since there were some known alternative hotels which I was told provided more of an 'American' experience in regards to food; and I wasn't able to work anything out with them. Initially, I didn't give LemonTree much of a chance. I went to my first breakfast but quickly walked out without eating anything; even though the assortment of options were very vast and diverse. I'm just not a huge fan of Indian cuisine and I have no tolerance for spicy foods. After a couple days, the strangest thing happened to me. 2 senior managers from the LemonTree showed up at my office to meet with me. They had noticed that I haven't been eating and wanted to know how they could be of assistance. They asked me what I like to eat and ensured me that they'd be able to cater meals based on my preferences. The next day, the head chef and a senior chef was knocking on my room door asking what I wanted for my meals throughout the day and week. All of this was amazing to me. I have stayed at many hotels all over the world, but this type of service was unprecedented. From that day forward, I was able to pick and choose what I wanted and the senior chefs were always the ones who followed up to ensure I was happy. This experience was all I needed to appreciate LemonTree, but there are so many more things to like. The pool area is very nice though it could use some more lighting at night. The hotel is very, very clean and I was impressed by the same-day laundry and next-day cleaners services. The front desk is very helpful and offers quick and inexpensive currency exchange. The location is ideal if you work for a technology company. The use of the cabs are relatively expensive (compared to other available less-convenient options); even if you are taking short trips; but the drivers are very friendly and helpful if you are a tourist. The only essential thing missing is a computer center; and you'll find it challenging to print anything (especially if you want to print something confidential); so be prepared to have a backup plan. Overall, it was a very good experience. Being a native New Yorker, I'm used to smiles and greetings being hard to come by.

The restaurant staff is very attentive - after several days, the waiters at breakfast knew what I wanted and so I did not have to order myself.

The gym is fabulous! Enough machines plus free weights for everyone. And extra clean and fresh smelling. Pool area on roof is pleasant and relaxing place to simply sit and have a cup of coffee in early morning after workout.

2515,Jul 2012,Good Value with Some Flaws,"Overall, the Lemon Tree isn't a bad hotel, and it's clear they're trying to get it right. But they are still far from the level of the Ista in Hyderabad or other world-class hotels. Their service is always friendly if not the most attentive or efficient. The bed was quite comfortable, the room fairly nice and complete with plenty of amenities, though I agree with other reviewers that the fragrance in the toiletries and soap is way overdone. Completely unacceptable for a hotel at this class level was only 30 minutes per day of free WiFi, which didn't even work well. As I expect in India, the power goes out continuously throughout the day, but there should be an uniterruptable supply for the equipment in the fitness center. It went out while I was on the treadmill, causing me to lunge forward. Had I not been expecting it as a high likelihood, I could have gotten hurt.

The food at breakfast was another serious drawback. When I'm eating spicy, heavy Indian food every day for lunch and dinner, I can't bear it for breakfast, too. Their attempt at western foods was abysmal, so I stuck with fruit and toast.

The previous few times in Hyderabad, I stayed at the Ista, which didn't have room for our whole group this time, but I'll make sure we get our reservation in earlier next time.

The 1 thing that bothered me the most was the intense smelling hand soap - which I think caused some discomfort.

The gym is very stocked with machines and weights. Ample LCD's to keep you entertained while you workout.

The Citrus Lunge has a good variety of food items in their complimentary breakfast buffet. I have not seen in many other 5 star properties the amount of items in the breakfast buffet.

Also the mid-night buffet is good and very affordable...timing starts from 00:30 am onwards.....only thing was that since the regular dinner must have got over before the mid-night buffet - the placements of the serving trays, warmers was not in order. But overall the service was very good and one can get warm fresh roti's and naans etc.

The small black and white T-shirts all over the hotel are really hilarious, and drive some good messages, which normally people take for granted. I wish I could buy them from the hotel and place in my home and office....they are framed and look good.

Room:

Rooms are large enough. I stayed in suites that had living room and bedroom. Two flat screen Tv's and 2 couch enough to sit 5 people as work from my room sometimes and had many guests often. Rooms are also similar as I stayed in about 3 different floors on my trips. I also stayed in the standard room which was also large enough similar to most descent North American hotels if not better. Very comfortable bed with the TV in the room and alarm clock as well as water placed on both sides of the bed daily. Two large windows that are sealed however you can ask to open them if needed. I look forward to coming back to my room and often stayed in weekend and as comfortable as my own home. Air quality is very good with temperature control unit that works well from 0-30 dial unit. I keep round 15 which makes the room cool enough.

Washroom:

Glass shower large enough with towels inside as well as shower head in place and movable shower head. Very clean and very bright if you needed to be total of 4 lighting switches. Good water pressure at all times. Large mirror and shaving mirror that you can move round. The washroom is not very large nor is it small sort in between.

Hotel:

Gym- I spend a lot of my time here it is on the 9th floor and has everything most gyms have.
most of the time you will be alone at the gym it is open 24 hours very clean at all times.
You may need to turn the lights on at night and it is all yours though no staff is round.

Food- Food is excellent I had most of the dishes local to international. Hyderabad is famous for biryani dishes and you don't leave lemon tree to have the best biryani. Kitchen staff is open to make you things you miss a the head chef will always greet you in the morning for breakfast.

Location: Google, HSBC, Dell are some of the companies that are within walking distance as
well as KFC and McDonald. It is located in the business district but you can get to
most places in 30 minutes and within an hour during peak hours. There is mall 10
minutes which has many places to eat mostly North American food chains.

Noise: Hotels in India have weddings and other events which can lead to a lot of noise when you
are trying to sleep. This hotel noise level is 0. I hardly hear any noise at night.

Staff- From cleaning your room to serving food by far this hotel has great staff that ensures
you are okay at all times and often know you by name. Excellent service by all of them.

As long staying guest, I enjoyed the service of the hotel, simple and clean with great lighting and gym and pool which I often enjoy by myself. It is quiet hotel generally which feels like home.

2521,May 2012,"Ok hotel for India, but certainly has it's problems","The hotel itself is newly built, cleaned meticulously, and air conditioned. The power goes (but it does have its own generators in case it is prolonged).

The problem however is the typical Indian service - many people there to achieve very little. Added to that nobody has the authority to do anything. My bill was wrong (I was suppose to get 4 pieces of laundry per day free), but eventually I gave in, even though it stated on their own bill it should have been free. I will instead write to the head office.

The gym is ok, good quality machines and weights, but setup wrong - the treadmills do not face the mirrors (nothing does) - it all needs rotating by 180 degrees! The massages are goo but expensive.

The restaurants however are where it all starts to go wrong. In trying to be impressive they try to put more 'stuff' and flavours on your plate. Consequently you end up with some odd looking, overly ornate, and not very nice flavours. The breakfasts were also a horror show or poorly made western food, and questionable Indian food (which doesn't taste like Indian food anywhere else in India).

Finally the value. Whilst the rooms are ok value, the mediocre food is expensive, and EVERYTHING there has a mandatory 10% service charge. Over my stay this added up to £200.

If you are there on business, it isn't a bad option, but if you can help it, try and go elsewhere for eating - not only will you save money, you might not go hungry.",3.0,May 2012,business,Anthony B,54,40,"York, United Kingdom",4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2.0

2528,Apr 2012,"Front desk terrible; rooms good; food ok; Bar has terrible, loud music.","I'm not picky; when I travel, I simply want a clean room, somewhere to relax and have a beer, and wifi. The room was clean and decent. They didn't stock any beer or wine in the fridge. They had a bar, but the music was extremely loud , you couldn't carry on a conversation, and on top of that, the music was really bad. It sounded like b-side 80's music . I can listen to most music, but not bad music at decibels I cannot hear the person sitting across from me. The table next to us asked them to turn down the music, and they said no! I did recognize a Michael Jackson song, but again it wasn't one of his hits, it's like that kind of music. I took my beer to the lobby for peace and quiet and was told I wasn't allowed to do that. I ate in the restaurant, and it was ok, it tasted like alot of the other Indian food I had but the 3 Indian guys I was with were not impressed. But what really annoyed me about this place, was upon checkout I was double charged for wifi for the day. I wanted them to remove it from my bill. It took about 30 minutes to do that. AFter 15 minutes I asked the guy if there was a problem, he ignored me . I asked him again. No response. I asked a 3rd time, and still, no response. My fellow traveler was Indian and explained that is how some Indians are, when they are busy they don't respond. The experience at the Westin was completely opposite: friendly, attentive, etc. And I might add that the reason we checked out was because both our Iphones had 0 coverage in the hotel; not sure if that was a hotel thing or not, but around the corner at the Westin we had phone coverage.
I will say the staff at breakfast was very friendly and the food was good. The front desk was horrible. They should send them over to the Westin to see how they should attend to customers.",2.0,March 2012,business,duffbeer,20,27,"Philadelphia, PA",3.0,1.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0

Rooms are very well done and functional and decorated in a tasteful ultramodern fashion. I liked the jokes splattered all over the Hotel - in the restaurant mats, picture frames and on framed tees! Service was great and prompt. Someone even got me a paracetamol at midnight, as I was running a fever. The restaurant serves excellent breakfast that is just right. The menu is different everyday and includes both Indian and continental fare, which is good for those like me who have a bad stomach for spices. I did notice though that windows in the hotel are sealed, even the ones in your room. This may be a little claustrophobic and may be unsafe in the event of a fire. If you want a quick bite, like a burger or something, you can quickly go down to the restaurant of the Red Fox - cleverly called the Clever Fox, which serves good burgers and other stuff for about 100-150 rupees!

The front desk is terrible though. Airport pick up was part of the package. Not only did the hotel not verify at what time our flight landed, it did not even apologize when I complained. I repeatedly faced issues with the travel desk. Vehicles would go to a different building EVERY time I asked for a pick up or not turn up. I had to call the front desk / transport desk at least thrice EVERY TIME I asked for a pick up. Very Very annoying.

The first thing that hits you when you enter the hotel is the lemon smell...supposed to be fresh...but for some reason keeps reminding you of the freshners used in Gyms, a little annoying when it's everywhere.

Stayed in a superior room. This time round they placed me in a 'ladies only' floor! Really apprecaited the amenities provided in a woman-specific bathroom. The service for in-room dining is good. However food options are fairly limited, you would see the same items being repeated under different headings. If you have the time and energy would suggest exploring other eateries. The fact that you do not have buffet-dinner is quite a let down.

The gym available in the hotel is quite good.

Had a bad time during check-out this time, kept asking front-desk to send someone with luggage, that was quite delayed. Finally had my luggage sent down after I went to the lobby area and spoke to the front desk executive personally. Secondly, noticed I was overcharged for laundry service, did not get an adequate explanation from either the frontdesk or housekeeping.

One was the very pungent smell of lemon when you walked in and on each floor. They have potpourri pots on each floor and if you are sensitive to smell, you may not want to stay here. It was a little overwhelming to myself and my husband and would recommend a little less. The hotel itself was beautiful and the breakfast and cappuccino was awesome. The other restaurants were very good as well offering selections other than Indian food which my husband didn't care for, the risotto was very very good. The bar is overrated as they charged us doubles when we ordered just a single drink and you can't take it out of the bar. They only have a liquor license for the bar area only and therefore you cannot get it in the restaurants. The power would go in and out frequently and I'm guessing they do not have generators at this time but guess this is common over there. The internet access was cumbersome as we paid for the week to access and each night to go in and try to access being already a registered guest it would not let us on and we had to have the technical gentleman come to our room almost each night. Customer service was good but sometimes they did not understand what you wanted them to do and tended to just ignore the question if they did not understand.

I ate at three restaurants (the cafe, Republic of Noodles and Kabob Theater) - the food was consistently enjoyable. I think the Republic of Noodles was my favorite. The breakfast buffet in the cafe was great.

If I could change anything, it would be the decor in the cafe - it is an attempt to be humorous that often devalues people. Maybe I'm just too serious.

After that minor scare, we did not encounter much issues from the hotel except for the iffy internet service and the lack of an iron (ironing is a payable service via the laundry) - the staff is friendly and the food at breakfast is serviceable.

Another reason I stayed was felicities. They have wider rooms and good window views than other same kind of hotels in Hyderabad. The gym and swimming pool were not so luxurious but enough for refresh.

2590,Aug 2011,"Exquisite property, Pleasant folks, yet, a stone throw away from..Classy!","Impeccable cleanliness and crisp looking lobby and rooms. Everything gels well and not a single decor overly/under done. Refreshing citrus smell, which smells more original than some imported perfume. Pleasing and caring staff only enhance your experience so far. Yet, one could feel that missing “something” that robs away the Star rating and the price tag.

I believe the moment a hotel crosses the Rs.5000 per night mark, it is in the 5+ Star league and the expectation by any traveller, business or family, goes up by many notches. Hence my comparison and so the comments below, is with the likes of William Penn, Sheraton etc.

Ambience: Impeccable and follows the theme to the letter, from wall to furniture. The yellow might be little too bright, but then it doesn’t stick out. The staff dress also carries the same theme. However its my feeling that it kinda makes them look like the counter staff at KFC or McDonalds, rather from a 5-Star Hotel. Maybe a designer's touch is required to perk it up.
I did feel little claustrophobic between the security check and main glass door. Just too small place to host a body scanning plus a hand-held metal detector sweep.

Rooms: The design and decoration is very simple, elegant and functional. The switches are within reach and lights are bright and good for reading. The television is standard but lacks variety in terms of channels. Given the fact that there are a number of free channels in India and also cable/satellite TV comes very cheap compared to other countries, one would expect more good entertainment channels.

Food: Be it the breakfast or lunch the spread is just wonderful. Having stayed for more than a week, I can safely say that most of the menu repeats, but certainly not at the cost of the taste. The Tomato Basil soup was so superb, I had 3 bowls one night! A smooth weave of South Indian, Continental, North Indian cuisines titillate your taste buds. A la carte might not go well with your purse though. Not to mention the very expensive in-room dining.

Service: Extremely nice staff. From the front desk to the door man to the coffee shop, everyone genuinely want you to have a nice time and pleasant stay. The beauty about dining in a big league hotels is the inconspicuous movement of the table waiters. Yet they appear just when you need some water or milk or juice!! Im thinking Lemon Tree management should plan some training in this direction!

Housekeeping: I did not know that something called “Towel Art” or “Towel Origami” existed until I found every evening, a Ganesha, butterfly, lotus and flowers decorated on my bed by the housekeeping. Credit goes to Mr.Pinto, one of the housekeeping staff. In general they do an impeccable job in maintaining the room clean. They also ensure your things are not moved around while cleaning, which is comendable! Make sure you crumple and throw the towel on the floor as the hotel believes in reusing and hence thinks so if you leave the towel on the bed/hook.

Fitness: Worry not if you have packed few pounds from the uninhibited indulging at the Citrus restaurant. The modest and simple yet functional gym at the 9th Floor helps you take care of that. It has all the required equipments for a Business traveller. More than required for lazy logs like me! It is indeed a thought that occurred to me, that the fitness center has only mirror on one wall and you are facing an odd looking poster while running on the treadmill. A thoughtful gesture, to place fresh towels and free water bottles in the gym. Surprisingly the same water bottles are CHARGED in the restaurant!!

Business Connectivity: This is one department the hotel falls way too short. The internet connection is chargeable to an obscene rate of Rs.150 per hour. Typically premium hotels offer in-room internet, free of cost and some tie it to their rewards program. The Business Center, when I enquired for checking mails, was booked. Though I did not venture again, saved by my Tata Photon! However, one wonders how much space/money it would take to throw in 10 simple, cheap PC with an LCD screen together for a free Business Centre and add it to the brochure!!?

Summary: It’s a really good hotel to stay. But not quite justifying the price tag. When you stay at a star hotel, a lot of things come as compliment. Making you feel really special. A basket of fruits, Fresh flowers, condiments, a Spa treatment, sight-seeing etc, is just to name a few. Im guessing “Raving Fans” needs to be made a Must-Read for all hospitality sector personnel!",4.0,August 2011,business,balajibv,10,4,"Gainesville, Florida",,4.0,5.0,,4.0,3.0

2594,Jul 2011,Better than Novotel for Business Travelers,"On my first business trip I stayed at Novotel and on my second trip I stayed at Lemon Tree. Next time I'll stay at Lemon Tree again. The hotel is sharp, clean, and modern. The rooftop pool is exquisite, private, and inviting for adults (Novotel's pool felt like it was for families). Lemon Tree's rooms were great. A few thing I really enjoyed about Lemon Tree over Novotel:
You can easily walk off the hotel grounds. In Novotel, with it's long drive way I felt trapped. The area around Lemon Tree isn't that interesting or pedestrian friendly, but at least you can wander around on your own in the evening.
Many of the guests at Lemon Tree were Indian travelers. Hey, I just flew around the world, do I really want to have breakfast in a room full of other white business guys every day? I could be in South Carolina for all I can tell and I could have saved myself 20hrs of traveling. While Lemon Tree and Hyderabad is far from a cultural visit to India, at least being among Indian travelers reminds you of where you are.
The staff at the Lemon Tree restaurants were friendly and approachable. At Novotel, everyone was extremely polite, but also very reserved.
The reason Lemon Tree only got three stars from me this time, was poor service from the front desk staff. On check out the manager asked me about it, listened thoughtful to my experience, gave me a small gift as an apology, and promised to address the issues. My main issue was the front desk seemed compelled to tell me they would help in five minutes even when it's going to be more like hours. The back story is that the day I checked in, the hotel was at 100% capacity. As a result the front desk was overwhelmed, but no one told me this. Instead everything was ""five minutes sir"" Check-in was slow, broken internet took 6 hrs to fix, a 110V adapter took four hours, but I was stuck waiting around expecting it to show up at any minute. After that the front desk was good except there were several mistakes on my bill.
I do believe they'll work through these issue and that my issues were expectional due to the 100% capacity. I'll be back - the room, pool, and food were too good not to give them a second chance.",3.0,June 2011,business,qhawkins,10,7,"Seattle, Washington",,3.0,5.0,,4.0,4.0

2597,Jun 2011,A great value for money hotel...But!!,"The hotel is in the heart of the HITECH city in Hyderabad... about 45 minutes from the airport.

I checked in pretty late in the night... and post check in (Which was fast), I was given the keys to my room which I had to figure out my self because there was no one who would guide me to my room or carry my luggage... so I carried my own bags.

BTW... guests have an option to pick up their welcome drink... which have been placed in dispensers in the lobby... so you can have a refreshing drink whenever you are in the lobby :-)

I was pleasantly surprised at the room size... nice and big and with a very nice view which I think for $120/night was worth it.

The quality of the toiletries leaves room for improvement.

The food part... taste wise as well as presentation better than average. The Chinese food is recommended , though the Indian didnt disappoint as well.

The breakfast is included with the room. A decent spread and service is very prompt.

The front office leaves room for improvement. I requested for a cab drop to my destination prior to my breakfast... and when I came back I had to wait for 15 minutes for the cabs... apparently, the front office guy had forgotten about the request.
I requested for a pick up in the evening... which was conveniently forgotten again... and I had to call up again.
upon my return... I requested the front office executive to kindly feed in the request for a drop and a pick up for the second day... and the same results... I had to wait for the cab.

I then had a chat with the hotel GM... Mr. Roy who was very patient and courteous in hearing my concerns.
For the third day I didnt have any problems with my drop and the evening drop to the airport... the cabs were waiting on both the occasions :-)

The staff is very courteous ( a lil laid back... but very courteous). Mr Roy has promised me better service next time ... so I am looking forward to return to check out his promise!",4.0,May 2011,business,Sarandeep,25,12,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",,4.0,4.0,,5.0,5.0
